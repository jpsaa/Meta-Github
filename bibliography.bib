The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic and standardized approach when linking health-status measures to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The specific aims are to develop rules, to test their reliability and to illustrate these rules with examples. Ten linking rules and an example of their use are presented in this paper. The percentage agreement between two health professionals for 8 health-status instruments tested is also presented. A high level of agreement between the health professionals reflects that the linking rules established in this study allow the sound linking of items from health-status measures to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.},

The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}) contains an exhaustive set of categories of information which constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable as a reference for comparing health information. Methods and results In two earlier papers, we have proposed rules for linking existing health information to the {ICF}. Further refinements to these existing {ICF} Linking Rules are presented in this paper to enhance the transparency of the linking process. The refinements involve preparing information for linking, perspectives from which information is collected and the categorization of response options. Issues regarding the linking of information not covered or unspecified within the {ICF} are also revisited in this paper. Conclusion: The {ICF} Linking Rules are valuable for enhancing comparability of health information to ensure that information is available in a consistent manner to serve as a foundation for evidence-based decision-making across all levels of health systems. The refinements presented in this paper enhance transparency in, and ultimately reliability of the process of, linking health information to the {ICF}. Implications for Rehabilitation The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}) constitutes a unified and consistent language of human functioning suitable as a reference for comparing health information. Comparability of information is essential to ensure that the widest range of information is available in a consistent manner for any decision-maker at all levels of the health system. The refined {ICF} Linking Rules presented in this article outline the method to establish comparability of health information based on the {ICF}.},

	abstract = {Meta-regression has become a commonly used tool for investigating whether study characteristics may explain heterogeneity of results among studies in a systematic review. However, such explorations of heterogeneity are prone to misleading false-positive results. It is unclear how many covariates can reliably be investigated, and how this might depend on the number of studies, the extent of the heterogeneity and the relative weights awarded to the different studies. Our objectives in this paper are two-fold. First, we use simulation to investigate the type I error rate of meta-regression in various situations. Second, we propose a permutation test approach for assessing the true statistical significance of an observed meta-regression finding. Standard meta-regression methods suffer from substantially inflated false-positive rates when heterogeneity is present, when there are few studies and when there are many covariates. These are typical of situations in which meta-regressions are routinely employed. We demonstrate in particular that fixed effect meta-regression is likely to produce seriously misleading results in the presence of heterogeneity. The permutation test appropriately tempers the statistical significance of meta-regression findings. We recommend its use before a statistically significant relationship is claimed from a standard meta-regression analysis.},

	abstract = {Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment effects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using meta-regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many comparative studies report results at multiple time points. Such data are correlated because they pertain to the same patients, but are typically meta-analyzed as separate quantitative syntheses at each time point, ignoring the correlations between time points.
{PURPOSE}: To develop a meta-analytic approach that estimates treatment effects at successive time points and takes account of the stochastic dependencies of those effects.
{METHODS}: We present both fixed and random effects methods for multivariate meta-analysis of effect sizes reported at multiple time points. We provide formulas for calculating the covariance (and correlations) of the effect sizes at successive time points for four common metrics (log odds ratio, log risk ratio, risk difference, and arcsine difference) based on data reported in the primary studies. We work through an example of a meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials of radiotherapy and chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the postoperative treatment of patients with malignant gliomas, where in each trial survival is assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post randomization. We also provide software code for the main analyses described in the article.
{RESULTS}: We discuss the estimation of fixed and random effects models and explore five options for the structure of the covariance matrix of the random effects. In the example, we compare separate (univariate) meta-analyses at each of the four time points with joint analyses across all four time points using the proposed methods. Although results of univariate and multivariate analyses are generally similar in the example, there are small differences in the magnitude of the effect sizes and the corresponding standard errors. We also discuss conditional multivariate analyses where one compares treatment effects at later time points given observed data at earlier time points.
{LIMITATIONS}: Simulation and empirical studies are needed to clarify the gains of multivariate analyses compared with separate meta-analyses under a variety of conditions.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Data reported at multiple time points are multivariate in nature and are efficiently analyzed using multivariate methods. The latter are an attractive alternative or complement to performing separate meta-analyses.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774507083567},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Longitudinal studies typically report estimates of the effect of a treatment or exposure at various times during the course of follow-up. Meta-analyses of these studies must account for correlations between effect estimates from the same study.
{PURPOSE}: To describe and contrast alternative approaches to handling correlations inherent to longitudinal effect estimates in meta-analyses.
{METHODS}: Linear mixed-effects models can account for correlations in a number of ways. We considered three alternatives: including study-specific random-effects, correlated time-specific random-effects or a general multivariate specification that also allows correlated within-study residuals. Data from a review of studies of the effect of deep-brain stimulation ({DBS}) in patients with Parkinson's disease are used to illustrate the application of these models.
{RESULTS}: are contrasted with those from a naïve meta-analysis in which the correlations are ignored. Results The data included 46 studies that yielded 82 estimates of the effect of {DBS} measured at 3, 6, 12 months or later after implantation of the stimulator. Models that accounted for correlations, particularly the full multivariate specification, provided better fit (lower {AIC}) and yielded slightly more precise effect estimates. This was in part due to a relatively extreme observation from a study that provided similar estimates at other times, which in the naïve approach exerts greater influence since it is treated as an independent observation.
{LIMITATIONS}: Since the true values of the parameters are not known, it is impossible to confirm that estimates from the multivariate approach are necessarily more accurate.
{CONCLUSION}: Standard meta-analytic models can be readily extended to account for correlations between effects in longitudinal studies. These models may provide better fit and possibly more precise summary effect estimates.},

	abstract = {We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research workers in various scienti?c disciplines to the use of information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a “best” model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0221735},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cognitive impairment affects up to 80 percent of the stroke population, however, both the available evidence about post-stroke cognition and the measures used to evaluate it longitudinally have not been well described. The aims of this systematic scoping review were: to identify and characterize studies evaluating cognition longitudinally after stroke; to summarize the cognitive instruments used and the domains they target; and to organize cognitive domains assessed using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}).
{METHODS}: We used a systematic scoping approach to search for peer-reviewed articles involving adults with stroke that evaluated cognition longitudinally. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full reports was completed independently by two reviewers, across six electronic databases ({PubMed}, {PsycInfo}, Medline, Cinahl Plus, Embase, and Web of Science). Cognitive domains were mapped to an {ICF} function independently by the same two reviewers, using a previously tested, standardized approach.
{RESULTS}: A total of 5,540 records were found; 257 were included, representing a total pooled sample of 120,860 stroke survivors. Of these studies, 200 (78\%) provided specific cognitive outcomes from the longitudinal evaluations, 57 (22\%) reported model predictions, and 77 (30\%) included interventions. Cognition was evaluated with 356 unique instruments, targeting 95 distinct cognitive domains, and 17 mental functions from the {ICF}. The Mini-Mental State Examination was the most frequently used instrument (117 reports, 46\%). Other tools used longitudinally were the Trail Making Test (17\% of reports), tests of verbal fluency (14\%), the Functional Independence Measure (14\%), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (13\%), the Digit Span (11\%), and the Stroop test (10\%). Global cognition was evaluated in 170 reports (66\%), followed by higher-level cognitive functioning (29\%), memory (28\%), language (21\%), attention (21\%), and perceptual skills (14\%). Studies using functional (or performance-based) cognitive assessments over time were scarce ({\textless} 1\%).
{CONCLUSION}: Our findings indicate that whilst there is a substantial number of studies available that report longitudinal evaluations of cognition after stroke, there is large variability in the measures used and the cognitive domains they target. Nonetheless, the available data for evaluation of cognition over time after stroke can be organized and described systematically.},

Subsequently, an informal follow-up study and a detailed analysis of the video-taped sessions of the approach were completed. Based on information from these studies, the approach was refined, key features elucidated and the protocol was specified. Next, a pilot randomized clinical trial was completed. The trial was conducted to determine how best to approach a full scale randomized clinical trial on the effectiveness of {CO}-{OP}, relative to the current therapeutic approach.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: The incidence of stroke and the demand for stroke rehabilitation services continues to increase, and it has been proposed that age be used in combination with severity of stroke to determine type of rehabilitation. It is important to identify the impact of age on functional outcome before embracing a system that limits access to rehabilitation on the basis of age.
{METHODS}: This prospective study includes all patients admitted to an inpatient stroke rehabilitation program for 6 years. Demographic and clinical data were extracted by means of chart review. Functional status at admission and discharge was evaluated by means of the {FIM} instrument. Multivariate regression techniques were used to assess the relationships between age, functional outcome, and other predictive variables. Particular attention was paid to the r(2) values to assess the amount of variation accounted for by the predictors.
{RESULTS}: Age alone was a significant predictor of total {FIM} score and Motor {FIM} score at discharge, but not {FIM} change. For both total {FIM} score and Motor {FIM} score at discharge, age alone accounted for only 3\% of the variation in outcome. For all the models, age explained at the most 1.3\% of the variation in functional outcome after adjustment for other factors, such as admission {FIM} score.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The small amount of variation that can be explained by age alone and the questionable clinical relevance of such a small effect suggest that there is no justification to deny patients access to rehabilitation solely because of advanced age.},

{METHODS}: As part of a longitudinal study of incident dementia after stroke, 115 older stroke survivors ({\textgreater}75 years of age) without dementia were evaluated at 3 and 15 months with a detailed neuropsychological evaluation (including memory, attention, executive performance, and language).
{RESULTS}: we found that 9\% of older stroke patients developed incident dementia, with significant deterioration in global cognition, memory, and attention. Only the severity of expressive language performance at 3 months was associated with dementia at follow-up. Conversely, 57 patients (50\%) experienced some improvement in global cognition. None of the criteria for early cognitive impairment identified people at increased risk for dementia.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Delayed dementia is frequent in older stoke patients, but current criteria for early cognitive impairment are not useful as predictors of cognitive deterioration. Improvement in cognition occurred in most patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Neuropsychological deficits occur in over half of the stroke survivors and are associated with the reduced functioning and a decline in quality of life. However, the trajectory of recovery and predictors of neuropsychological outcomes over the first year post stroke are poorly understood.
Method: Neuropsychological performance, assessed using the {CNS}-Vital signs, was examined at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after ischaemic stroke ({IS}) in a sample drawn from a population-based study (N = 198).
Results: While mean scores across neuropsychological domains at each time-point fell in the average range, one in five individuals produced very low-range scores for verbal memory, attention and psychomotor speed. Significant improvements were seen for executive functioning, psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility within 6 months post stroke, but no gains were noted from 6 to 12 months. Stroke-related neurological deficits and depression at baseline significantly contributed to the prediction of neuropsychological function at 12 month follow-up.
Conclusions: In a significant minority of {IS} survivors, focal deficits are evident in psychomotor speed, verbal memory, executive functions and attention. Significant improvements in these domains were only evident in the first 6 months post stroke. Initial stroke-related neurological deficits and concurrent depression may be the best predictors of later cognitive functioning.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Our aim was to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy signal of early donepezil administration with regard to enhancing recovery in a diverse acute ischemic stroke population.
{METHODS}: This was a multicenter, single-arm, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator trial-controlled, modified 2-stage adaptive clinical trial set in 2 tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Adults with ischemic stroke treated within 24 hours after onset of symptoms were included. The intervention studied was donepezil 5 mg/day for 30 days, followed by an increase to 10 mg/day for 60 days. Our main outcome measures included treatment-related adverse events and side effects. The primary favorable outcome was a 90-day National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) score ≤1. Neurologic, cognitive, functional, and psychological outcomes were assessed longitudinally.
{RESULTS}: Thirty-three adults (median age 66 years; 59\% female; 39\% received tissue plasminogen activator) initiated treatment with donepezil. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Three participants (9\%) discontinued donepezil because of side effects and 3 participants (9\%) required a reduction to 5 mg/day after titration to 10 mg/day. Fifteen participants (45\%) had a favorable outcome ({NIHSS} score ≤1 at day 90), and the study met prespecified criteria for continuing to a randomized trial (P {\textless} .10). Statistically significant improvements from baseline were observed with several secondary cognitive measures, including the Trail Making Tests and Mini-Mental State Exam (P {\textless} .01 for both).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Adjuvant donepezil therapy initiated within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke was safe and tolerated at 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day. The study met a priori criteria to move forward with a randomized clinical trial.},

We investigated the relationship between {MRI} small-vessel disease markers (including a composite cerebral amyloid angiopathy, {CAA}, score) and cognitive trajectory over 12 months. We included patients from the {CROMIS}-2 {AF} study without pre-existing cognitive impairment and with Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) data. Cognitive impairment was defined as {MoCA} {\textless} 26. We defined "reverters" as patients with an "acute" {MoCA} (immediately after the index event) score {\textless} 26, who then improved by ≥ 2 points at 12 months. In our cohort (n = 114), 12-month {MoCA} improved overall relative to acute performance (mean difference 1.69 points, 95\% {CI} 1.03-2.36, p {\textless} 0.00001). 12-month cognitive impairment was associated with increasing {CAA} score (per-point increase, adjusted {OR} 4.09, 95\% {CI} 1.36-12.33, p = 0.012). Of those with abnormal acute {MoCA} score (n = 66), 59.1\% (n = 39) were "reverters". Non-reversion was associated with centrum semi-ovale perivascular spaces (per-grade increase, unadjusted {OR} 1.83, 95\% {CI} 1.06-3.15, p = 0.03), cerebral microbleeds (unadjusted {OR} 10.86, 95\% {CI} 1.22-96.34, p = 0.03), and (negatively) with multiple ischaemic lesions at baseline (unadjusted {OR} 0.11, 95\% {CI} 0.02-0.90, p = 0.04), as well as composite small-vessel disease (per-point increase, unadjusted {OR} 2.91, 95\% {CI} 1.23-6.88, p = 0.015) and {CAA} (per-point increase, unadjusted {OR} 6.71, 95\% {CI} 2.10-21.50, p = 0.001) scores.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Patients with stroke are at risk for developing cognitive impairment. We tested whether the assessment of balance and gait can enhance the prediction of long-term cognitive outcome in stroke survivors.
{METHODS}: Participants were patients with first-ever, mild-moderate ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from the Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort ({TABASCO}) study, a large prospective cohort study, who underwent 3-T {MRI} and were followed for ≥2 years using neurological, neuropsychological, and mobility examinations 6, 12, and 24 months after the index event.
{RESULTS}: Data were available for 298 patients (age: 66.7±9.6 years). Forty-six participants (15.4\%) developed cognitive decline ({CD}) over the 2 years of follow-up. The {CD} group and cognitively intact group did not differ in their neurological deficits or in their infarct volume or location. Nonetheless, 6 months after stroke, the Timed Up and Go test took longer in those who later developed {CD} (P{\textless}0.001). Additionally, the {CD} group also had lower Berg Balance Scale scores (P{\textless}0.001), slower gait (P{\textless}0.001), and fewer correct answers during dual-task walking (P=0.006). Separate analyses of the patients with transient ischemic attack revealed similar results. Multivariate regression analysis showed that Timed Up and Go times {\textgreater}12 s at 6 months after stroke/transient ischemic attack was a significant independent risk marker of {CD} 24 months after stroke (odds ratio=6.07, 95\% confidence interval: 1.36-27.15).
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that measures of balance and gait are significant risk markers of cognitive status 2 years after stroke. Relatively simple, performance-based tests of mobility may enhance the identification of stroke/transient ischemic attack survivors who have an increased risk of developing {CD}.

{METHODS}: For 451 patients hospitalized for acute stroke, scores were recorded at admission and discharge for 5 {FIM} items (transfers, eating, walking, expression, and memory). The sum of the 5 {FIM} items and functional change between admission and discharge were calculated.
{RESULTS}: The {FIM} scores were internally consistent (alpha = .894 and .918) and reflected 1 factor. Functional independence increased (t = 17.46, P {\textless} .001) over a mean 5.5 days. Regression analysis showed the same variables (admission function, {NIHSS} score, length of stay, age, and total therapy units) to best predict discharge function (R2 = .804) and function change (R2 = .184).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Together, 5 easily observed {FIM} items demonstrated that functional independence increased during hospitalization. Discharge function and functional change were predicted significantly (but weakly) by therapy units.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Stroke is a major cause of short-term functional impairment, but the recovery timeframes are not well-established.
{AIM}: This study aims to evaluate the progression of functional recovery during the first 24 weeks after acute ischemic stroke, to determine the timeframes for motor, cognitive, and overall recovery.
{DESIGN}: Prospective observational study.
{SETTING}: Tertiary care center; 12-week inpatient period, followed by 12-week outpatient period.
{POPULATION}: A group of 131 patients with acute stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery with age 18-85 years-old.
{METHODS}: Patients received treatment according to routine clinical practice and underwent a closely-controlled rehabilitation program for 24 weeks. Functionality assessments were conducted at 48 hours, 3 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after acute stroke and included the modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}), the Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}), and the Stroke Upper Limb Capacity Scale ({SULCS}).
{RESULTS}: Over the study period, patient functionality improved significantly (P{\textless}0.001) as measured by all scales. Assessment scores improved significantly from 48 hours to 3 weeks for all scales; the same occurred from 3 weeks to 12 weeks, except for C-{FIM}. From 12 weeks to 24 weeks, there were no statistically significant functional improvements for any scale. In comparative terms, cognitive impairment was less severe than motor disability in the acute phase. C-{FIM} scores at 48 hours were significantly higher than M-{FIM} and {mRS} scores. Upper limb functioning measured by {SULCS}, showed a intermediate degree of disability compared to the C-{FIM}, M-{FIM}, and {mRS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Functional recovery occurs at least until 24 weeks after acute stroke, but most of the functional gains tend to be achieved during the first 12 weeks. Cognitive function tends to improve earlier than motor function, with the most substantial gains occurring within the first three weeks. From 12 to 24 weeks there are observable numerical gains in patient functionality, highlighting the need to maintain an adequate rehabilitation program.
{CLINICAL} {REHABILITATION} {IMPACT}: This study provides insight into the recovery timeframe for stroke patients, which can support the development of more effective rehabilitation programs.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Fever is associated with worse functional outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}); however, there are few prospective data to quantify the relationship with health-related quality of life ({HRQoL}). We tested the hypothesis that increased burden of fever is independently associated with decreased {HRQoL} at follow-up.
{METHODS}: In this prospective observational cohort study of 106 {ICH} patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital between 2011 and 2015, we recorded the highest core temperature each calendar day for 14 days after {ICH} onset. Fever burden was defined as the number of days with a fever ≥ 100.4 °F (38 °C). {HRQoL} outcomes were measured with Neuro-{QoL} domains of Cognitive Function and Mobility at 28 days, 3 months, and 1 year. Results were analyzed using mixed effects regression analysis.
{RESULTS}: Each additional day with a fever was independently associated with lower Mobility {HRQoL} (T-score - 0.9, [- 1.6 to - 0.2]; p = 0.01) and Cognitive Function {HRQoL} (T-score - 1.3 [- 2.0 to - 0.6]; p = 0.001) after correction for National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission, age, and time to follow-up.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Each additional day with a fever was predictive of worse {HRQoL} domains of Cognitive Function and Mobility after {ICH} up to 1 year. These data extend previous evidence on the negative association of fever and functional outcomes to the domains of Cognitive Function and Mobility {HRQoL}. {HRQoL} outcomes may be a sensitive and powerful way to measure the efficacy of fever control in future research.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: (1). To examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and operationally defined depressive disorder (major depression) in an Irish sample of subjects undergoing inpatient rehabilitation following their first stroke. (2). To investigate factors predictive of depression following stroke. (3). To examine the relationship between post-stroke depression and outcome following inpatient rehabilitation.
{METHODS}: Fifty consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria who were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation to a specialised unit following their first stroke were prospectively studied.
{INCLUSION} {CRITERIA}: first stroke 3 - 12 months previously, lesion identified on {CT} or {MRI}, age 18 - 65 years, at least some sensory/motor impairment, no pre-existing disabling condition and Barthel Index score {\textgreater} 14 prior to stroke. Mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, {DSM}-{IV} diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder), Cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination) and Disability (Barthel Index, Rankin Disability Scale) were assessed one week after admission (baseline) and again after 2 months of rehabilitation. Outcome was measured as effectiveness of rehabilitation (Shah et al., 1990) and length of inpatient stay ({LOS}).
{RESULTS}: 10/50 (20\%) of the sample met criteria for major depressive disorder on admission. The best predictor of depression was gender, with females having a two-fold higher rate of both subjectively reported and objectively rated depressive symptoms. Depression was unrelated to baseline Barthel Disability, side of lesion or previous psychiatric history. The best predictor of effectiveness of rehabilitation was baseline Barthel Disability score. Depression did not predict either effectiveness or {LOS}.
{CONCLUSION}: (1). Major depression is common in subjects undergoing rehabilitation following their first stroke. (2). Females appear to be especially at risk, possibly reflecting an increased general risk of depression. (3). Depression in our sample was not related to functional disability following stroke or early functional outcome following rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Intracranial atherosclerosis ({ICAS}) is a common etiology of ischemic stroke in Chinese patients, probably leading to regional hypoperfusion in the brain. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the association between {ICAS} and poststroke depression in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke.
{METHODS}: During the study period, a total of 569 patients aged between 40 and 80 years with acute ischemic stroke were consecutively admitted and screened. Patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) total score of 15 or higher, with severe cognitive impairment, or with a history of depression before stroke were excluded. Two hundred seven patients with ischemic stroke were consecutively recruited in the study. Depressive symptoms were assessed in the acute stage and 3 months after stroke. Poststroke depression was defined as a score of 8 or higher in the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The evaluation of the magnetic resonance imaging scans focused on infarctions, white matter lesions, brain atrophy, and {ICAS}.
{RESULTS}: In the acute stage of stroke, logistic regression revealed that female sex, {NIHSS} score at admission, prestroke insomnia, and {ICAS} were significant predictors of poststroke depression. At 3 months after stroke, prestroke insomnia, the Mini-Mental State Examination score and {ICAS} were significant predictors of poststroke depression.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {ICAS} may be a significant independent predictor of poststroke depression in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke.},

{DESIGN}: Assessment of overall and cognitive-communicative function was conducted on admission to acute rehabilitation, at discharge, and at 3-month follow-up.
{SETTING}: Urban, acute inpatient rehabilitation facility.
{PATIENTS}: Fifty-two consecutive admissions of adult right-handed patients with a single, right hemispheric stroke, confirmed by computed tomography scan.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The {FIM} instrument and reading comprehension and written expression items of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago Functional Assessment Scale(R).
{RESULTS}: Patients made significant functional gains between admission and discharge, and between discharge and follow-up on the {FIM}. Severity of neglect was correlated with total, motor, and cognitive {FIM} scores at admission, discharge, and follow-up. Subjects with neglect had significantly more days from onset to admission and a longer length of rehabilitation stay than subjects without neglect. {FIM} outcomes were significantly different for subject groups with more severe neglect. Both the presence of neglect and its severity were significantly related to functional outcomes for reading and writing.

	doi = {10.1177/1545968317723752},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}) is assumed to play a role in mediating neuroplasticity after stroke. Carriers of the function-limiting Val66Met (rs6265) single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) may have a downregulation in {BDNF} secretion, which may lead to a poorer prognosis after stroke compared to noncarriers in motor learning and motor function recovery. The present study investigates whether this polymorphism may also affect the recovery of poststroke aphasia (ie, language impairment).
{OBJECTIVE}: To study the influence of the {BDNF} Val66Met polymorphism on the recovery of poststroke aphasia.
{METHODS}: We included 53 patients with poststroke aphasia, all participating in an inpatient rehabilitation program with speech and language therapy. All patients were genotyped for the Val66Met {SNP} and subdivided into carriers (at least one Met allele) and noncarriers (no Met allele). Primary outcome measures included the improvement over rehabilitation time on the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test ({ANELT}) and the Boston Naming Test ({BNT}).
{RESULTS}: The outcome measures showed a large variability in the improvement scores on both the {ANELT} and {BNT}. There was no significant difference between noncarriers and carriers in the primary outcome measures.
{CONCLUSION}: This study investigated the effect of the {BDNF} Val66Met polymorphism on clinical recovery of poststroke aphasia. In contrast to earlier studies describing a reducing effect of this polymorphism on motor function recovery after stroke, the present study does not support a reduction in language recovery for carriers compared to noncarriers with poststroke aphasia.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Cognitive decline occurs in approximately 30\% of stroke patients. Acute risk factors have been identified, but long-term risk has not been examined in large samples. The purpose of this research was to determine factors associated with the progression of cognitive impairment after stroke.
{METHODS}: Consecutive stroke patients (193) without previous dementia were assessed 3 months after stroke with an extensive neuropsychological battery and diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition criteria and the Clinical Dementia Rating as normal (139), cognitive decline without dementia (18), or dementia (18 mild, 10 moderate, and 8 severe). After a 24-month follow-up, they were classified as stable, progressing, or improving, according to change in Clinical Dementia Rating score. The determinants of progression of cognitive decline were ascertained by logistic regression analysis of all clinical, neuroimaging, and complementary data.
{RESULTS}: Cognitive status at 24 months was stable in most cases (151; 78.2\%), decline progressed in 27 (14\%; 6 demented and 21 nondemented), and improved in 15 (7.8\%; 7 demented and 8 nondemented). Seven nondemented patients became demented at 24 months, and 5 demented became nondemented. The age (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.05; 95\% {CI}, 1.01 to 1.1), mental decline before stroke ({OR}, 1.14; 95\% {CI}, 1.02 to 1.27), number of prescribed drugs ({OR}, 1.34; 95\% {CI}, 1.05 to 1.72), diastolic blood pressure on admission ({OR}, 0.96; 95\% {CI}, 0.93 to 0.99), and episodes of hypotension during admission ({OR}, 7.61; 95\% {CI}, 1.11 to 52.1) were significantly associated with cognitive deterioration.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Cognition is rather stable for 2 years after stroke. Both progression and improvement of cognitive impairment are frequent in demented patients. Age, previous cognitive decline, polypharmacy, and hypotension during admission are risk factors for progression.},

{OBJECTIVES}: Our purpose was to investigate the frequencies and determinants of poststroke {CI} in the hispano-mestizo population of Santiago, Chile.
{METHODS}: A prospective study of hospitalized patients aged {\textgreater}60 years admitted with an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was conducted. The cognitive status was determined at 3 and 12 months after the stroke by informant questionnaires, neuropsychological testing and clinical diagnosis. Cardiovascular risk factors, brain imaging and stroke features were analyzed using regression models to establish determinants for poststroke {CI}.
{RESULTS}: A total of 164 patients (mean age = 72 +/- 7.5 years) were recruited. Out of 122 patients (74\%) evaluated at 3 months, 81 (66\%) had {CI}.

{METHODS}: A total of 40 patients over 18 years of age enduring a transient ischemic stroke or minor stroke within the past 3 months who had a minimum life expectancy of 1 year were included in this study. Same number, age-, and sex-matched individuals were included as controls. Patients were inquired on the presence of risk factors for stroke. A series of neuropsychological test batteries were administered in patient and control subjects for assessing cognitive functions. These tests were readministered at 6 and 12 months of follow-up to assess the progression of cognitive functions.
{RESULTS}: In this study among the patients with stroke, a significant impairment was seen in multiple cognitive functional tests following ischemic stroke as compared to control groups. The most common risk factors for stroke included hypertension (72.5\%), hyperlipidemia, and cigarette smoking. The number of cognitive domains with an impairment was highest (in four cognitive tests) among those with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, followed by those who had a {\textgreater}50\% stenosis in Doppler (three cognitive tests). These findings suggest that the frequency of risk factors associated with stroke does not correlate with the frequency of risk factors associated with cognitive dysfunction. The stroke localizations were classified among the patients with stroke and reviewed in accordance with cognitive impairment.
{CONCLUSION}: Neuropsychological tests, clinical findings, and imaging studies should be used to document the poststroke cognitive dysfunction.},

	title = {Outcome predictors of rehabilitation for first stroke in the elderly},
	volume = {44},
	issn = {1973-9087},
	abstract = {{AIM}: The prediction of stroke outcome in the elderly can be rather difficult, due to the potential interference into disability and handicap development of several clinical modifiers, such as comorbidity, medical complications, neuropsychological impairment proper to the aging brain and social issues. These factors can strongly affect old patient response to rehabilitation and need to be taken into account, along with ageing per se, to optimize health resource efficiency for the care of disability due to stroke. In this study, we tried to identify outcome determinants of stroke rehabilitation specific for the elderly.
{METHODS}: A total of 359 first-stroke patients aged 75 years, admitted for active rehabilitation treatment to hospital rehabilitation wards, were enrolled into a multicenter cohort (prospective) study. They all underwent a comprehensive medical rehabilitation program. We considered as primary outcomes the frequency of home discharge and the extent of functional recovery, assessed by Functional Independence Scale ({FIM}) and expressed as the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score ({MRFS}) efficacy. Each measure of outcome was related to age, as well as other potential clinical and functional confounders, according to a multivariate model. For each dependent variable, two models were developed, using either {FIM} total score or {FIM} domains scores at admission among predictors.
{RESULTS}: {FIM} total score increased from 55.8+/-24 to 75.3+/-30 (P{\textless}0.0001), with a mean {MRFS} efficacy of 0.33+/-0.25. Most patients (79.9\%) were discharged home. Age turned out as independently and inversely related to {MRFS}, explaining at the most 3.6\% of its variance, although {FIM} at admission was its most powerful predictor. Home discharge was not related to age, but to social issues, such as living in family before admission, and cognition.
{CONCLUSION}: The present study suggests that rehabilitation can be effective in elderly stroke patients, in improving function as well as in favorably affecting discharge destination. In fact, age per se predicts the outcome at a lesser extent than other clinical covariates, such as functional and cognitive status at admission and social situation.},

	abstract = {{OBJECT}: To investigate whether resting-state functional connectivity ({FC}) differed in the default mode network ({DMN}) in stroke patients with and without post-stroke cognitive impairment ({PSCI} vs. Non-{PSCI}) and to explore the relationship between {DMN} connectivity and the cognitive performance in stroke patients.
{METHODS}: We totally enrolled twenty healthy controls and 18 stroke patients. The stroke patients were divided into two subgroups on the basis of the cognitive assays. Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) and Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) scores were recorded 10 days and 3 months after the stroke. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the {DMN}. One-way analysis of variance was performed to detect different {FC} among groups. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between {FC} strength and the {MoCA} and {MMSE} scores.
{RESULTS}: Compared to healthy controls, both Non-{PSCI} patients and {PSCI} patients showed significantly decreased {FC} in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus ({PCC}/{PCu}), as well as increased {FC} in the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) and left hippocampus. However, Non-{PSCI} patients showed more significantly increased {FC} in the {MPFC} and hippocampus than {PSCI} patients did. The {FC} in the {PCC}/{PCu} was related to the {MoCA} score measured at a 10-day follow-up, and the {FC} in the left hippocampus predicted the {MoCA} score measured at 3 months follow-up.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanism underlying {PSCI}, and suggests that resting-state {DMN} connectivity could serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for future interventional studies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There has been a growing interest in the use of robotic therapy to improve walking ability in individuals following stroke.
{OBJECTIVES}: The aim of this retrospective study was to compare conventional physiotherapy ({CP}) with robotic training ({RT}) combined with {CP} and to measure the effects on gait, balance, functional status, cognitive function, and quality of life in patient with stroke.
{METHODS}: We retrospectively identified 107 cases of new cerebral stroke. They were allocated into 2 groups. In the {RT} group (n = 36), patients received {RT} (Lokomat; 2 times per week) combined with {CP} (3 times per week) for at least 30 sessions. In the {CP} group (n = 71), patients received a program at least 30 sessions, 5 times per week. The evaluation parameters included modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale ({MASS}), Brunnstrom Recovery Scale ({BRS}), Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}), Functional Ambulation Categories ({FAC}), Berg Balance Scale ({BBS}), Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}), and Short Form-36 ({SF}-36) Health Survey.
{RESULTS}: Posttreatment results showed significant improvements for all parameters (except lower extremity {MASS} scores) in both groups. However, when we compared the percentage changes of parameters at discharge relative to pretreatment values, improvements in {FIM}, {MMSE}, and all subparts of {SF}-36 were better in the {RT} group (P {\textless} .05). Comparison of posttreatment evaluation parameters for categorical variables showed that the lower extremity categories in the {BRS} were significantly better in the {RT} group than the {CP} group (P {\textless} .05).
{CONCLUSION}: {RT} combined with {CP} produced better improvement in {FIM}, {MMSE}, {BRS} lower extremity categories, and all subparts of {SF}-36 of the patients with subacute and chronic stroke (up to 1 year) than the {CP} program.},

	abstract = {Stroke is an important risk factor for dementia, but the exact mechanisms involved in cognitive decline remain unclear. In this study, we related baseline {MRI} brain measures with later cognitive decline. Seventy-nine stroke survivors aged 75+ years without dementia were recruited 3-month post-stroke. They underwent yearly neuropsychological assessments and had an {MRI} at baseline and 2 years. Medial temporal lobe atrophy ({MTA}) was scored and volume of white matter hyperintensities ({WMH}) was measured at baseline. The rate of ventricular enlargement was measured by comparing the baseline and repeat images. Linear regression indicated that memory loss was related to both baseline memory and {MTA} (p=0.001; standardized regression coefficient beta=-0.35) but not {WMH} volume. The only independent predictor of ventricular enlargement was {MTA} (p=0.003; beta=0.47). However, no baseline {MRI} variable differed between those who did (18\%) and did not (82\%) develop dementia. The association of {MTA} but not {WMH} with subsequent cognitive decline and increasing brain atrophy suggests a greater role for Alzheimer type than vascular pathology in delayed cognitive impairment after stroke.},

	abstract = {Objectives This study assessed cognitive performance of subjects with aphasia during the acute stage of stroke and evaluated how such performance relates to recovery at 3 months. Materials \& methods Patients with aphasia following a left hemisphere stroke were evaluated during the first (baseline) and the fourth-month post onset. Assessment comprised non-verbal tests of attention/processing speed (Symbol Search, Cancelation Task), executive functioning (Matrix Reasoning, Tower of Hanoi, Clock Drawing, Motor Initiative), semantic (Camel and Cactus Test), episodic and immediate memory (Memory for Faces Test, 5 Objects Memory Test, and Spatial Span. Recovery was measured by the Token Test score at 3 months. The impact of baseline performance on recovery was evaluated by logistic regression adjusting for age, education, severity of aphasia and the Alberta Stroke Program Early {CT} ({ASPECT}) score. Results Thirty-nine subjects (with a mean of 66.5 ± 10.6 years of age, 17 men) were included. Average baseline cognitive performance was within normal range in all tests except in memory tests (semantic, episodic and immediate memory) for which scores were ≤-1.5sd. Subjects with poor aphasia recovery (N = 27) were older and had fewer years of formal education but had identical {ASPECT} score compared to those with favorable recovery. Considering each test individually, the score obtained on the Matrix Reasoning test was the only one to predict aphasia recovery (Exp(B)=24.085 p = 0.038). Conclusions The Matrix Reasoning Test may contribute to predict aphasia recovery. Cognitive performance is a measure of network disruption but may also indicate the availability of recovery strategies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between blood pressure variability ({BPV}) and poststroke cognitive impairment ({PSCI}).
{METHODS}: Seven-hundred ninety-six patients with acute ischemic stroke were included in this study. Midterm {BPV} was evaluated by calculating the {SD} and coefficient of variation ({CV}, 100 × {SD}/mean) of systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) and diastolic blood pressure during the 7 days after stroke onset. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) at admission and at all follow-up visits. Patients with {MoCA} scores {\textless}26 were considered to have {PSCI}.
{RESULTS}: The incidence of {PSCI} reached its peak (72\%) 3 months after stroke onset and decreased to 30.3\% at 12 months poststroke. After adjusting for covariables, the increase in the prevalence of {PSCI} at 3 months was independently associated with increases in the {CV} of blood pressure during the 7 days after stroke [odds ratios and 95\% {CI} for patients in the second to fifth quintiles of {SBP} {CV} were 2.28 (1.18, 4.39), 2.33 (1.18, 4.62), 2.69 (1.31, 5.53), and 4.76 (1.95, 11.67), respectively]. Sub-analysis of the {MoCA} scores revealed that the patients had impairments in visuoperceptual abilities and executive functions, as well as in naming and delayed recall (p {\textless} 0.05).
{CONCLUSION}: Midterm {BPV} during the early phase of acute ischemic stroke is independently associated with {PSCI}, especially in the visuoperceptual, executive, and delayed recall domains.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIMS}: Little is known about the possible effects of social resources on stroke survivors' level and change in cognitive outcomes. Understanding this association may help us identify strategies to improve stroke recovery and help elucidate the etiology of dementia.
{METHODS}: We examined the relationship of social ties and social support to cognitive function and cognitive change 6 months after stroke. Participants in the Families in Recovery from Stroke Trial ({FIRST}) (n = 272) were interviewed approximately 17 days (baseline) and 6 months (follow-up) after stroke. Cognition was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) and a summary battery of 7 neuropsychological tests. Median-based regression was used to model cognitive outcomes by level of baseline intimate, personal and organizational social ties and received emotional and instrumental support.
{RESULTS}: Baseline social ties and emotional support independently predicted 6-month Cognitive Summary Scores. Emotional support also predicted greater improvements in Cognitive Summary Scores from baseline to the 6-month follow-up. No other social exposures predicted improvements in the {MMSE} or the Cognitive Summary.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results suggest that emotional support may promote cognitive resilience while social ties provide cognitive reserve that protects against impaired cognition after stroke. Social ties did not predict cognitive recovery however, so reverse causation cannot be ruled out.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To assess whether, and to what extent, cognitive outcome relates to overall functional outcome among elderly stroke patients.
{DESIGN}: Nonconcurrent prospective study.
{SETTING}: Geriatric rehabilitation division at a large, urban, academic, freestanding hospital in Israel.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Three hundred thirty-six patients aged 60 years and older admitted consecutively for rehabilitation after first acute stroke. Inclusion criteria were met by 315 patients, who were included in the final analysis. Average age was 75.3 years. The stroke was right sided in 44.1\%.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Not applicable.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The motor subscale of the {FIM} instrument assessed functional status. Absolute functional gain was determined by the {FIM} motor gain. Relative functional gain was calculated according to the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score. Cognitive status was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) and the {FIM} cognitive subscale.
{RESULTS}: {FIM} scores increased significantly during rehabilitation, mainly due to improvement in motor functioning. A strong association was found between the cognitive scales (r=.853, P{\textless}.001). Better rehabilitation outcomes were observed in patients with higher admission cognitive status, adjusting for the effect of age, sex, onset to admission interval, length of stay, and severity of stroke (odds ratio = 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5-2.5).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Impaired cognitive status at admission negatively affects the rehabilitation outcome of elderly stroke patients. The utility of routinely using a cognitive test for all patients before admission to rehabilitation, preferably the {MMSE}, is emphasized. The time, cost, and effort involved in performing such a test are negligible, and the potential benefits are considerable.},

This study also explored the interaction between cognitive impairment and depression., Methods: A total of 820 patients with {PSD} from a massive multicenter prospective cohort project in China ({PRIOD}) were included in the present study. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17 Items, {HDRS}-17) at 2 weeks and the endpoint of the 3-month follow-up. The cut-off score of {HDRS}-17 ({\textless} 8) was used to define remission of depression at the endpoint. The Mini-Mental State Exam ({MMSE}) was used to evaluate the cognitive impairment of the patients (at the 2-week follow-up and 3-month endpoint). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) was used to measure the severity of stroke., Results: (1) Six hundred and forty-two patients completed the 3-month follow-up, and 332 (51.7\%) patients remitted by the end of the study. Univariate analyses indicated that there was a higher proportion of patients who had hypertension, frontal lobe lesion, basal ganglia lesion, poor outcome at 2 weeks, high scores on the {NIHSS} at 2 weeks, major life events within 3 months, and major medical diseases within 3 months in the nonremission group. In stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses, remission was significantly predicted by lower {NIHSS} scores at 2 weeks (p = 0.001, {OR} = 1.086, 95\% {CI} 1.035–1.139), fewer major life events (p = 0.036, {OR} = 5.195, 95\% {CI} 1.111–27.283), fewer major medical comorbidities (p = 0.015, {OR} = 2.434, 95\% {CI} 1.190–4.979), and fewer frontal lobe lesions (p = 0.042, {OR} = 1.717, 95\% {CI} 1.019–2.891).

In particular, we were interested in the additional value of neglect measures besides hemiparesis, hemianopia, cognitive deficits and age.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: A consecutive series of 57 patients with a neuroradiologically verified right hemisphere infarct was examined within 10 days of the stroke. Fifty patients were followed up for 1 year. Neglect was measured with the Conventional and the Behavioural subtests of the Behavioural Inattention Test ({BITC} and {BITB}, respectively). The predictors were determined at the 10-day examination. Functional outcome was assessed 3, 6 and 12 months after the onset with the Frenchay Activities Index.
{RESULTS}: Neglect in {BITB} was the best single predictor, which together with high age formed the best combination of predictors for poor functional outcome at each follow-up. Hemiparesis was also included in this prediction model at the 3-month follow-up, but hemianopia, {BITC}, or visuoconstructional and memory deficits showed no additional predictive value. However, neglect usually recovered soon. When neurological and cognitive deficits were assessed at the same time as the outcome, hemiparesis rather than neglect was the strongest correlate of poor outcome.
{CONCLUSION}: Neglect in acute stroke is an important predictor of poor functional recovery. Residual neglect, which could be compensated in the follow-up tests, may nevertheless restrict patients' real-life activities and hobbies.},

This study examined the presence of rightward bias after right hemisphere stroke within 10 days of stroke onset and after 6 months. Our sample comprised 43 patients and 49 healthy controls. Presence of {VN} was evaluated with the six conventional subtests of the Behavioral Inattention Test ({BITC}). Starting points were determined in three {BITC} cancellation tasks by measuring the distance between the starting point and the median line of the stimulus sheet in centimeters. Activities of daily living ({ADL}) were assessed with the Barthel Index. At baseline {VN} patients showed more robust rightward bias than patients without {VN}. The magnitude of rightward bias decreased clearly in the {VN} patients at follow-up. A favorable {ADL} outcome was observed in 90\% of the patients with {VN} and in all of the patients without {VN}. The magnitude of rightward bias differed clearly between the patient groups and controls. Our result implies that {VN} was likely to have improved as measured by {BITC} sum scores, but symptoms of rightward attention bias were still detected. We therefore suggest that, for clinical purposes, it is important that attention bias is measured accurately after right hemisphere stroke.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1028-768X},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Atherosclerosis of the intracranial arteries is a well-recognized cause of ischemic stroke in Asians, and extracranial carotid artery disease is more often seen in western countries. The relationship of common carotid artery intima-media thickness ({CCA}-{IMT}), intracranial arteries stenosis ({ICS}) and vascular cognitive impairment ({VCI}) after ischemic stroke has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the relationship between {CCA}-{IMT} and the severity of {ICS} and {VCI}.
{METHODS}: We recruited patients from December 2004, to June 2005, with the inclusion criteria: (1) first-ever ischemic stroke, (2) admission within 3 days of stroke onset, (3) under 80 years old, and (4) no previous dementia history. We excluded patients with stroke scores greater than an {NIHSS} of 15; those with recurrent stroke, and those with extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis {\textgreater} 50\%. All the patients underwent brain {MR} angiography, carotid ultrasonography and neuropsychological testing during hospitalization and at 3 months after stroke. We defined the percent of {ICS} using the method of Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease. Measurement of {CCA}-{IMT} was made on the far wall of the common carotid artery, 1.5 cm proximal to the bifurcation at a point free of plaques. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Cognition Assessment State Instrument ({CASI}).
{RESULTS}: Thirty patients (21M/9F, mean age 65.97 +/- 10.33 years) were studied. The initial {CCA}-{IMT} was 1.04 +/- 0.59 mm and the initial {CASI} was 64.73 +/- 14.75. The {ICS} was 70 +/- 26\%. At 3 months after stroke, the {CCA}-{IMT} was 1.06 +/- 0.59 mm; and {CASI} was 70.07 +/- 18.50. Compared with patients with {CCA}-{IMT} {\textgreater} 0.87 mm, those with {CCA}-{IMT} {\textless} or = 0.87 mm had lower {ICS} (57 +/- 23\% vs. 81 +/- 24\%, p = 0.013), but similar initial {CASI} score (67.92 +/- 13.52 vs. 61.93 +/- 16.64, p = 0.28). The improvement of {CASI} score at 3 months was significantly higher in patients with {CCA}-{IMT} {\textless} or = 0.87 mm (67.92 +/- 13.52 vs. 77.36 +/- 14.12, p = 0.001), than those with {CCA}-{IMT} {\textgreater} 0.87 mm (61.93 +/- 16.64 vs. 63.69 +/- 19.89, p = 0.612).
{CONCLUSIONS}: {CCA}-{IMT} might be associated with the severity of {ICS} and {VCI} at 3 months after the first-ever ischemic stroke. The patients with lower {CCA}-{IMT} had a better {CASI} evaluation at 3 months after stroke. A larger scale of study to explore the association of {CCA}-{IMT}, {VCI} and {ICS} at 3 months after stroke might help farther delineation of these relationships.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: This paper is a report of a study to identify the changes in poststroke quality of life and other clinical issues among older Chinese adults from 1 month to 6 months after stroke and the predictors of poststroke quality of life at 6 months.
{BACKGROUND}: Stroke survivors are known to suffer from prolonged and multiple impairments leading to a compromised quality of life, but few studies report early predictors for quality of life among older Chinese adults after active rehabilitation has been undertaken during the first 6 months after stroke.
{METHOD}: A total of 214 patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke were interviewed by a research nurse at 1 month and 188 patients were interviewed again 6 months after hospital admission for stroke. Assessment of quality of life was done using the Modified Rankin Scale for Quality of Life. Changes in and relationships between quality of life and variables in five domains were explored: bio-anatomical, physical, emotional, cognitive, communicative and social support. The data were collected in 2004-2005.
{RESULTS}: Quality of life among two-thirds of participants was unchanged or lower when scores at 1 month and 6 months after stroke were compared. Length of hospital stay after admission for stroke and other 1-month factors - level of worry over current health, cognitive and self-care deficits - were identified as having independent effects on quality of life at 6 months.
{CONCLUSION}: Clinicians need to observe for early signs of mild cognitive impairments and emotional needs of stroke survivors, as well as to consider longer-term interventions to enhance poststroke quality of life.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to compare the time-course changes in neurologic impairments (trunk control, motor function, sensory, and cognition) and recovery in functional impairments (activity of daily livings and gait) simultaneously from initiating rehabilitation to 6 months after stroke. Consecutive stroke patients were recruited from the department of nervous surgery, and transferred into the department of rehabilitation medicine and continued on treatment during the acute stage. Outcome measures were examined at the initial rehabilitation baseline, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after rehabilitation treatment, and 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after stroke. Patients were assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Motor and Sensory Assessments for the upper and lower limbs, Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Ambulation Category, and Modified Barthel Index. Twenty consecutive patients were analyzed in the study with complete assessments. The recovery was relatively rapid during the 4 weeks after treatment (P value ranges from {\textless}0.001 to {\textless}0.007) and then to a lesser extent decelerated between 3 and 6 months after stroke (P value between {\textless}0.001 and 0.080). Statistical comparison by repeated measures analysis showed a significant interaction between time points and measures of all recovery variables (P{\textless}0.001). Significant differences in level of impairments and functional recovery were found at the different time points. In comparison with the lower leg and trunk control, the upper arm showed less recovery, with a significant difference. All variables except for leg motor function improved continuously over 6 months after stroke. Nevertheless, this study confirms the importance of the period within 3 months for recovery after stroke, during which most of the recovery occurred, ranging from 48 to 91\%. Therefore, intensive treatment targeting motor and sensory functions early after stroke may be beneficial for recovery of impairments and functional performance.},

	abstract = {Objective
Anxiety is one of the most common complications in patients with stroke, but studies on its relationship to functional outcomes are limited and controversial. We investigated the association between post-stroke anxiety ({PSA}) and a 1-year trajectory of functional outcome.


Methods
A total of 423 patients were recruited within 2 weeks after a stroke (acute phase) during hospitalization. Of them, 306 (72.3\%) completed follow-up examinations 1 year thereafter (chronic phase). Anxiety was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale, and functional outcomes were measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale for stroke severity, the Barthel Index for activities of daily living ({ADL}), and the Mini-Mental State Examination for cognitive function at 2 weeks and 1 year. A range of demographic and clinical covariates were considered. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between {PSA} and functional outcomes were investigated.


Results
{PSA} at the acute phase was not associated with functional outcomes at the cross-sectional point, but predicted worsening of outcome on stroke severity and {ADL} 1 year after stroke. {PSA} at the chronic phase was cross-sectionally associated with poor functional outcomes in all three measures. All associations were independent of potential covariates.


Conclusion
Screening for anxiety is recommended even during the acute phase of stroke, considering its independent detrimental effect on functional prognosis. Screening for anxiety during the chronic phase is also encouraged, as this may reflect the functional status of stroke.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study investigated the association between small vessel disease ({SVD}) burden, a combination of multiple {SVD} markers and cognitive dysfunction after stroke.
{METHODS}: The study sample comprised 451 patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke. Cognitive functions were assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) at 3, 9, and 15 months after the index stroke. Cognitive impairment was defined as an {MMSE} score of ≤26. A total {SVD} score, indicating {SVD} burden, was constructed by summing the scores of the 4 {SVD} markers (white matter hyperintensities [{WMHs}], lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and perivascular spaces) ascertained by magnetic resonance imaging (range: 0-4). The association between {SVD} burden and cognitive dysfunction was assessed with linear mixed models or generalized estimating equation models, as appropriate.
{RESULTS}: The majority of patients had mild-to-moderate stroke and at least one identifiable {SVD} marker. Cognitive impairment was found in about one-third of patients. After adjusting for confounding factors, the {SVD} burden was associated with {MMSE} scores (β = -0.37, P = .003) and cognitive impairment (odds ratio [{OR}] = 1.20, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.02-1.42). {SVD} burden was specifically associated with the performance of {MMSE} subscores including orientation to place and time, calculation, and word recall. Of the {SVD} markers, {WMHs} was the most robust predictor of decrease in {MMSE} scores (β = -0.25, P = .01) and cognitive impairment ({OR} = 1.14, 95\% {CI} = 1.01-1.29).
{CONCLUSION}: Cerebral {SVD} burden is associated with decreased {MMSE} scores, suggesting cognitive dysfunction during the first year after mild-to-moderate acute ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Background
There are few longitudinal studies with controversial results examining delayed changes in cognition after ischemic stroke and predictive values of neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers.

Objective
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delayed changes in cognition in poststroke patients and their relationship to the neuropsychological and neuroimaging markers measured during the acute poststroke phase.

Methods
Eighty-five first-ever stroke inpatients (mean age 65.6±5.6 years) without previous cognitive complaints were prospectively evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at the 5th day and the 1st, 6th, and 12th months. A wide range of clinical, radiological, and neuropsychological variables were examined.

Results
Our results showed significantly poorer performance on mini–mental state examination, memory, attention/executive functions, and processing speed in patients with stroke in comparison with stroke-free cognitively intact controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that hippocampal atrophy is the strongest predictor of delayed cognitive impairment. Secondary divided subgroups according to Isaacs Set Test ({IST}) score showed that patients with {IST} score ≤28 had different patterns of cognitive and neurological impairment after 1 year. Baseline impairments in attention/executive functions and memory were associated with development of dementia in poststroke patients.

Conclusion
Executive functioning deficit appears to have a predictive power for cognitive impairment progression. The study suggests that {IST} as a screening test has a potential to be a reliable and quick tool for poststroke cognitive impairment evaluation and delayed cognitive and neurological outcome. Hippocampal atrophy was the strongest predictor for cognitive impairment outcome, even in poststroke cognitive impairment. The findings may set the stage for better poststroke management.},

{RESULTS}: Lacunar stroke patients were more impaired than controls in general and executive functions at both time points. Both groups had similar stability in all psychometric tests. Patients, but not controls, exhibited a trend for improvement in general cognitive functions overtime (interaction term, p=0.084). No patient who was non-demented at baseline became demented during the study period.

	abstract = {Aim:Rehabilitation is proven to improve function following a stroke. The functional outcomes of stroke patients and benefits from rehabilitation are highly variable. We aim to describe functional outcomes and gains following inpatient rehabilitation post-stroke and identify factors associated with improved outcomes.Methods:In this five-years prospective study, data for 1332 consecutive stroke patients admitted to the Singapore General Hospital inpatient rehabilitation unit were charted into a custom-designed rehabilitation database. The primary outcome measure was the Functional Independence Measure ({AFIM}) and discharge ({DFIM}). The functional gain was defined as the {DFIM}-{AFIM}.Results:The mean age was 64.1±12.5 years, 58.9\% were male patients and 78.9\% consisted of ischaemic (versus haemorrhagic) strokes. The average rehabilitation length of stay ({RLOS}) was 18.7±13.9 days and the majority (87.7\%) were discharged home. The most common risk factor was hypertension (78.4\%) and urinary tract infection (21.2\%) was the commonest post-stroke complication. The mean {AFIM} and {DFIM} scores were 67.9±23.0 and 83.2±23.5 respectively with a mean functional gain of 15.4±12.3 {FIM} points. Younger, male, and haemorrhagic stroke patients had better functional outcomes. Multiple regression analysis results revealed that higher {DFIM} score was associated with higher admission motor and cognitive {FIM} scores, younger age, male gender, employment at admission, single patients, presence of a caregiver, haemorrhagic stroke, right-sided motor impairments, absence of urinary tract infection or depression, acupunction treatment, and a longer {RLOS}. The regression model on functional gain was associated with similar independent predictors on {DFIM} scores except that a higher {AFIM} was associated with lower functional gains.Conclusion:In this large cohort study, stroke patients make significant functional gains and should be offered rehabilitation to improve outcomes. A comprehensive set of multiple interacting demographic, clinical, cultural, and social factors significanctly impact on stroke functional outcomes after inpatient rehabilitation. The identification of these factors allows optimising rehabilitation for individual patients, and is important for discharge and resource planning.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) is nowadays recommended for the screening of poststroke cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the temporal evolution of {MoCA}-assessed cognition after stroke. The objective of this study was to examine the temporal pattern of overall and domain-specific cognition at 2 and 6 months after stroke using the {MoCA} and to identify patient groups at risk for cognitive impairment at 6 months after stroke.
{METHODS}: Prospective cohort study in which 324 patients were administered the {MoCA} at 2 and 6 months post stroke. Cognitive impairment was defined as {MoCA}{\textless}26. Differences in cognitive impairment rates between 2 and 6 months post stroke were analyzed in different subgroups. Patients with {MoCA} score {\textless}26 at 2 months, who improved by ≥2 points by 6 months, were defined as reverters. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify determinants of (1) cognitive impairment at 6 months post stroke and (2) reverter status.
{RESULTS}: Between 2 and 6 months post stroke, mean {MoCA} score improved from 23.7 (3.9) to 24.7 (3.5), P{\textless}0.001. Prevalence of cognitive impairment at 2 months was 66.4\%, compared with 51.9\% at 6 months (P{\textless}0.001). More comorbidity and presence of cognitive impairment at 2 months were significant independent predictors of cognitive impairment 6 months post stroke. No significant determinants of reverter status were identified.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although cognitive improvement is seen ≤6 months post stroke, long-term cognitive deficits are prevalent. Identifying patients at risk of cognitive impairment is, therefore, important as well as targeting interventions to this group.},

{BACKGROUND}: Despite the prognostic importance, temporal changes in post-stroke cognitive impairment have not been systematically investigated.
{DESIGN}: A non-experimental, prospective, longitudinal descriptive study design.
{METHODS}: Fifty-two stroke patients were enrolled. Data were collected from April 2015 to September 2017. Cognitive function was evaluated at 5 different times (immediately, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-stroke).
{RESULTS}: Significant changes in cognitive function following stroke exhibited an "s-shaped" curve, and the most rapid changes were observed between 3 and 6 months after stroke. The incidence of post-stroke cognitive impairment ranged from 23.1\% to 42.3\% and was highest at 3 months and lowest at 6 months. Gender, educational level, pre-stroke cognitive and functional abilities, haematoma, and brain surgery were associated with incidence of post-stroke cognitive impairment.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The ongoing changes exhibited by patterns of cognitive impairment provide evidence that consistent efforts are required to achieve positive changes in post-stroke cognitive function. Our findings may be helpful to develop nursing care strategies aimed at improving cognitive ability and consequently the quality of life of stroke patients.},

Repeated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) was used in this study to examine longitudinal changes in the default-mode network ({DMN}) during the 6 months after stroke, and to investigate the relationship between {DMN} changes and cognitive recovery. Out of 24 initially recruited right-hemispheric stroke patients, 11 (eight males, mean age 55.7 years) successfully completed the repeated {fMRI} protocol. Patients underwent three {fMRI} sessions at 1, 3 and 6 months after stroke. Their {DMNs} were analysed and compared with those of 11 age-matched healthy subjects (nine males, mean age 56.2 years). Correlations between {DMN} connectivity and improvement of the cognitive performance scores were also assessed. The stroke patients were found to demonstrate markedly decreased {DMN} connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobes at 1 month after stroke. At 3 months after stroke, the {DMN} connectivity of these brain areas was almost restored, suggesting that the period is critical for neural reorganization. The {DMN} connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the contralesional hemisphere showed a significant correlation with cognitive function recovery in stroke patients, and should be considered a compensatory process for overcoming cognitive impairment due to brain lesion. This is the first longitudinal study to demonstrate the changes in {DMN} during recovery after stroke and the key regions influencing cognitive recovery.},

Longitudinal studies on {PSD}, essential to determine its prognosis, are lacking from developing countries. This prospective study was undertaken to assess the prevalence, natural history, and correlates of depression among {SS} in an Indian community.
{METHODS}: From a community based stroke registry, {SS} were assessed annually for cognition, disability, and depression using Bengali validated scales. {PSD} was diagnosed if score on geriatric depression scale was greater than or equal to 21. Complex sample strategy was considered when calculating prevalence of post stroke depression. An age- and sex-matched case-control study was undertaken to determine the odds of depression in {SS}.
{RESULTS}: Prevalence of {PSD} was 36.98\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 31.89\%-42.06\%) among 241 patients assessed at baseline. About 17\% developed depression annually and a similar proportion had spontaneous improvement. Peak rate of {PSD} was beyond 3 months and continued up to 18 months after stroke. Compared to the non-depressed group, {PSD} subjects were significantly older, had higher age at first stroke, less education, lower socioeconomic status, and greater cognitive impairment and disability. Education had a protective role. Mortality in {PSD} was nearly twice that in non-depressed patients, though not significant statistically (hazard ratio: 1.84; 95\% {CI}: 0.90-3.77). Compared with controls, odds ratio of {PSD} was 19.95 (95\% {CI}: 10.09-39.47).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Approximately one-third of {SS} develop {PSD}, similar to developed countries. Prevalence remains stable annually. Delayed peak of {PSD} suggested later realization of underlying disability. Predictors of {PSD} have been described and higher literacy was protective in this study.},

We prospectively examined the role of the affected hemisphere and the lesion site in the occurrence and recovery of language deficits in nonthalamic subcortical stroke. Forty patients with unilateral basal ganglia stroke underwent language assessment within 1 week, 3 months and 1 year after stroke. Disturbances in at least one language domain were observed in 35 patients during the first week post stroke including aphasia diagnosed in 11 patients. Importantly, the appearance of deficits after stroke onset and the improvement of language function were not determined by the site of subcortical lesion, but instead were critically influenced by the affected hemisphere. In fact, the language impairments following left and right basal ganglia stroke mirrored the language dysfunction observed after cortical lesions in the same hemisphere. A significant overall language improvement was observed at 3 months after stroke, although residual deficits in language executive function were the most commonly observed impairment at 1 year follow-up. Although a substantial improvement of language function can be expected after nonthalamic subcortical stroke, our findings suggest that language recovery may not be fully achieved at 1 year post stroke.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Acute cognitive impairment and delirium occur after major stroke and are associated with poor cognitive outcome. We conducted a population-based study to determine whether transient cognitive impairment ({TCI}) is seen acutely after cerebral transient ischemic attack ({TIA}) or minor stroke, and whether it predicts long-term cognitive decline.
{METHODS}: Mini-mental-state examination was performed in consecutive testable patients with {TIA} or minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤3) seen acutely (1-7 days) in the Oxford Vascular Study (2002-2005) versus after 7 days, and in referrals seen acutely who had a subsequent noncerebrovascular diagnosis. We defined {TCI} as a baseline Mini-mental-state examination score ≥2 points below the 1-month follow-up score, and identified cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [{MoCA}] {\textless}26/30) and severe dementia at 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up.
{RESULTS}: In 280 {TIA} and minor stroke patients (mean age/{SD} 73.5/11.8 years), {TCI} was more frequent in those seen at 1 to 7 days (80/206; 38.9\%) versus later (14/74; 19\%; P=0.002) or in noncerebrovascular patients (10/47; 21\%; P=0.004). {TCI} was associated with acute confusion ({OR}, 5.5; 95\% {CI}, 2.5-11.7; P{\textless}0.0001), acute infarct on computed tomography ({OR}, 2.0; 1.2-3.5; P=0.01), and with residual focal deficits ({OR},1.94; 1.13-3.34; P=0.01). However, it was still seen acutely in those whose focal deficits had resolved by time of assessment (41/120; 34\%). Although patients with {TCI} had similar Mini-mental-state examination score by 1 month compared with those without {TCI}, their 5-year risks of cognitive impairment ({OR}, 4.3; 1.2-15.7; P=0.03) and severe dementia ({OR}, 4.9; 1.0-25.8; P=0.05) were increased.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {TCI} is a manifestation of {TIA} and minor stroke, and may persist beyond resolution of focal symptoms. Our findings have implications for definitions in {TIA} and minor stroke and suggest that cognitive fragility may be revealed by minor cerebrovascular events.},

	abstract = {Background: The nature, rate and pattern of recovery in bilingual persons with aphasia has been investigated over many years but several controversies remain. Recent evidence suggests that the relationship between executive function ({EF}) processes and language recovery may be distinct in bilinguals. An improved understanding of such underlying linguistic and cognitive processes may enhance assessment and treatment particularly in the acute phase. There is limited knowledge regarding how these processes interact and there remains little guidance as to the choice of an appropriate assessment battery. There is a need to develop a simple, effective battery which is sensitive to recovery processes, and in a multicultural and multilingual context, is able to distinguish normal from pathological profiles.Aims: The research study aimed to identify an assessment battery for language and {EF} that is sensitive to the recovery process for South African bilingual persons with aphasia at two time periods within the first 12 weeks post stroke.Methods and Procedures: A longitudinal comparison study was conducted at two acute rehabilitation centres. A sample of 10, second language English-speaking participants with aphasia ({PWA}) were assessed at two time periods within the first 12 weeks post stroke using the Comprehensive Aphasia Test ({CAT}) and a non-verbal {EF} battery. A matched control group of 19 neurologically intact bilingual, second language English speakers was assessed on the same battery on two occasions.Outcomes and Results: A between-group analysis identified statistically significant differences between the bilingual aphasic and control groups for language assessment as well as on the {EF} assessment (measuring updating, inhibition and shifting). The battery of tests also distinguished testing period and was appropriate for a variety of cultural groups. Distinctive profiles emerged across time for both language and {EF} subtests for the {PWA}.Conclusion: The combined battery appeared appropriate for the context and the results confirmed prior research suggesting that executive functioning may offer some explanations for differential recovery profiles. Exploring this distinct clinical profile may strengthen the decision-making process with regard to the type and language medium of therapy. Persistent {EF} deficits suggest the need for a cautionary interpretation of a bilingual advantage in the acute stage. Effective management in the acute phase of aphasia should be based on an understanding of recovery patterns, what is driving that pattern, and which cognitive deficits are contributing to the language behaviour. Delineating separate {EFs} and their linguistic correlates in bilinguals may aid management choices.},

{PARTICIPANTS}: Patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke who had driven before their stroke (n=290) who participated in a longitudinal study of stroke outcomes.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Driving resumption 1 year after the initial stroke diagnosis.
{RESULTS}: One hundred seventy-seven patients (61\%) returned to driving after 1 year. Direct relationships were found between measures of strength and motor activity (Stroke Impact Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), type of stroke (hemorrhagic vs ischemic), and driving resumption at 1 year. The effects of stroke severity, fatigue, and sex on driving resumption were mediated through strength and motor activity shown by a model that had excellent fit (comparative fit index=.985, Tucker-Lewis Index=.952, root mean square error of approximation=.046).
{CONCLUSIONS}: There are multiple direct and indirect influences on driving resumption at 1 year, from the type of stroke, physical strength and motor activity, cognition, sex, and fatigue measured at 3 months. The paths outlined by this model highlight how stroke sequelae influence community mobility, as well as factors related to driving resumption that are amenable to intervention.},

{METHODS}: One hundred and thirty-three working-aged patients with first-ever ischaemic strokes underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessment and evaluation for {PSF} and depressive symptoms at three months, six months, and two years after stroke. Cognitive domains evaluated included processing speed, memory, executive functions, and reasoning. Fatigue and depressive symptoms were assessed with subscales of the Profile of Mood States.
{RESULTS}: Patients (mean age: 54 ± 9.5 years, 64.7\% male) were divided into groups with (n=33) and without (n=100) {PSF} at three months after stroke. Patients with {PSF} at three months after stroke had slower processing speed at three months (p=0.003) and six months (p=0.013) after stroke and worse memory performance at six months (p=0.003) after stroke than patients without {PSF}.

The study group comprised 286 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55-85 years who at 3 and 15 months after ischemic stroke completed a detailed medical, neurological and radiological stroke evaluation, structured measures of cognition (Mini Mental State Examination), emotion (Beck Depression Inventory, {BDI}), disability (Rankin scale), and assessment of dependent living. Suicidal ideas were present in 9.8\% (n = 28) at 3 months' follow-up and in 14.0\% (n = 40) at 15 months' follow-up.

This study examined these effects of {CEA} on patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.
{METHODS}: This was a prospective controlled study that included 80 patients with minor strokes who had severe extracranial internal carotid stenoses ({\textgreater}70\%). Forty patients, who did not receive or who postponed the {CEA} due to concerns about age, fear of surgery, limited life expectancy because of cancer, or financial problems, formed the medicine-treatment group. Another 40 patients who received {CEA} 1 week after recruitment formed the {CEA} group. For both groups, visual acuity chart tests, perimetry tests, audiometry tests, and neurologic scales (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Mini Mental State Examination, and Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living) were used to assess ophthalmic functions, auditory acuity, and neurocognitive functions before treatment and 3 months after treatment. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons were conducted to examine the effect of {CEA}.

The intragroup and intergroup comparisons of ipsilateral function showed that {CEA} could improve visual acuity, visual field, and auditory acuity at all tested frequencies (250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) and could improve the visual field and the auditory acuity for contralateral functions at 1000 Hz. The auditory acuity at 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz were unchanged in the intragroup comparison but showed no deterioration in the intergroup comparison with the medicine group. General neurocognitive function and independent living ability were significantly improved by {CEA}, as shown by intergroup comparisons (change rate of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: -8.1\% ± 9.0\% vs -2.7\% ± 3.0\%, P {\textless} .001; change rate of Mini Mental State Examination: 15.5\% ± 10.5\% vs 1.6\% ± 2.6\%, P {\textless} .001; change rate of Barthel Index: 28.0\% ± 24.6\% vs 2.0\% ± 5.5\%, P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with minor strokes caused by severe carotid stenosis, {CEA} improves neurocognitive, ophthalmic, and acoustic functions. Studies with a larger sample and longer follow-up are needed to substantiate these results, and the underlying mechanisms need further investigation.},

Majority of the stroke survivors are left with significant physical and cognitive impairments. In addition to the improved acute stroke care, they often benefit from rehabilitation in improving their function. This was the first study done to document function for post stroke patients in Malaysia. It was prospective study conducted to document functional status of acute stroke patients upon admission, discharge and at 3 months post stroke. Assessment of functional status for these patients are based on their activities of daily living and ambulation i.e. self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication and social cognition. It is also aimed to describe their demographic and clinical characteristics. Correlation of functional status at 3 months post stroke with the initial severity of stroke was also explored. A total of fifty-one patients with acute stroke in University Malaya Medical Centre ({UMMC}) were recruited. The patient's age ranged from 38 to 83 years with a mean of 60.2 years. Thirty-six patients (71\%) were first stroke sufferers and fifteen patients (29\%) had recurrent stroke. At discharge from acute stay, 13\% of patients were able to ambulate with aids and 87\% needed assistance for ambulation in varying degrees. Eighty-two percent of patients showed improvement in overall function (both motor and cognition) at 3 months post stroke. Sixty percent of patients were independent in ambulation and 40\% required assistance. Significant correlation was seen between the initial severity of stroke and functional status at 3 months post stroke. Functional status of patients with stroke has improved at 3 months post stroke. A comprehensive rehabilitation medicine programme should be incorporated into management of stroke patients to expedite functional recovery and improve patient's independence.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Formal assessment of cognitive impairment is rare in acute stroke, yet. It was the goal to utilize easy-to-apply established screening tests to assess cognitive impairment from any cause in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
{METHODS}: 209 consecutive patients (69.8 +/- 13.3 years, mean +/- {SD}; 117 male, 92 female) admitted to an acute stroke unit, which serves as a community stroke center, and diagnosed as having acute cerebral ischemia from any cause were investigated within 24 h of stroke onset and in part followed up after 3 months. Orientation and aphasia were assessed with the {ADAScog} subscales orientation and aphasia, verbal memory with Buschke's Memory Impairment Screen, and concentration/working memory with a letter sorting test.
{RESULTS}: On admission, 74.6\% were impaired on the Memory Impairment Screen, 77.0\% on the letter sorting test, 45.0 and 24.9\% on the {ADAScog} subscales aphasia and orientation. Results of the Memory Impairment Screen and letter sorting test were similar at the follow-up after 3 months.
{CONCLUSION}: Formal brief assessment of cognitive deficits with tests not requiring motor capabilities in unselected patients with an acute cerebral ischemic event reveals widespread deficits. This needs to be considered when obtaining informed consent from the patients and instructing them. Routine formalized screening may thus improve care for patients with acute stroke. Patients with impairment on admission should be followed up, diagnosed concerning preexisting or poststroke dementia with a more extensive workup and eventually treated.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To assess the importance of 'disengagement failure' and 'attentional gradient' in unilateral spatial neglect ({USN}) and in recovery from neglect.
{METHOD}: Eight right-hemisphere-damaged stroke patients performed the standardized Behavioural-Inattention-Test battery for visual neglect, line-bisection tests, and two computerized reaction-time ({RT}) tasks: a variant of Posner's 'Spatial-Cueing' paradigm (with special emphasis on the magnitude of leftward disengagement time) and a signal-detection task (marking the spatial gradient of attention by the distribution of {RTs} to target stimuli in different spatial locations). The correlation between the different measures was assessed at two points in time, before and after a period of rehabilitation treatment.
{RESULTS}: A recovery pattern could be identified in both {RT} paradigms. However, the correlation between standard measures of neglect and performance on both, spatial-cueing and signal-detection tasks, was weak.
{CONCLUSION}: Neither difficulty disengaging attention from an ipsilesional stimulus nor changes in the attentional gradient can fully explain the processes underlying {USN} and its recovery. A large interpersonal variance exists among {USN} patients in the expression of disengagement and other spatial-attention deficits. Hence, individual patients should be tested by measuring different factors known to play a role in {USN}. This information is crucial for assigning the appropriate treatment for each patient in accord with the specific deficit revealed.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of brain cortical volume on cognitive outcomes using a voxel-based morphometry approach in subjects without prestroke dementia.
{METHODS}: Ischemic stroke patients were prospectively recruited 24 to 72 hours post stroke (M0). Cognition was evaluated at M0, 3 months, and 1 year (M12) using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Isaacs set test, and the Zazzo's cancellation task. A 3-T brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at M0. Grey matter ({GM}) was segmented using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 software. Association between global {GM} volume and cognitive score slopes between M0 and M12 was evaluated using a linear mixed model. Correlations between focal {GM} volumes and changes in cognitive performance were evaluated using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12.
{RESULTS}: Two-hundred forty-eight patients were included (mean age 65±{SD} 14 years old, 66\% men). Global {GM} volume was significantly associated with changes in Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (β=0.01; P=0.04) and in the number of errors on the Zazzo's cancellation task (β=-0.02; P=0.04) independently of other clinical/radiological confounders. Subjects with lower {GM} volumes in the left fronto-temporo-insular cortex were more vulnerable to transient Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Isaacs set test impairment. Subjects with lower {GM} volumes in right temporo-insular cortex, together with basal ganglia, were more vulnerable to transient cognitive impairment on the Zazzo's cancellation task.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Smaller cortical volumes in fronto-temporo-insular areas measured 24 to 72 hours post stroke are associated with cognitive vulnerability in the subacute stroke phase.},

However, its neurocognitive mechanisms, especially the relative contribution of perceptual and cognitive factors, are still unclear. We studied cognitive and auditory processing in the amusic brain by performing neuropsychological testing as well as magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) measurements of frequency and duration discrimination using magnetic mismatch negativity ({MMNm}) recordings. Fifty-three patients with a left (n = 24) or right (n = 29) hemisphere {MCA} stroke ({MRI} verified) were investigated 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke. Amusia was evaluated using the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia ({MBEA}). We found that amusia caused by right hemisphere damage ({RHD}), especially to temporal and frontal areas, was more severe than amusia caused by left hemisphere damage ({LHD}). Furthermore, the severity of amusia was found to correlate with weaker frequency {MMNm} responses only in amusic {RHD} patients. Additionally, within the {RHD} subgroup, the amusic patients who had damage to the auditory cortex ({AC}) showed worse recovery on the {MBEA} as well as weaker {MMNm} responses throughout the 6-month follow-up than the non-amusic patients or the amusic patients without {AC} damage. Furthermore, the amusic patients both with and without {AC} damage performed worse than the non-amusic patients on tests of working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest domain-general cognitive deficits to be the primary mechanism underlying amusia without {AC} damage whereas amusia with {AC} damage is associated with both auditory and cognitive deficits.},

We investigate the ability of early {QEEG} assessment to inform such prediction, using binary logistic regression. Thirty-five patients (12 female, ages 18-87) suffering middle cerebral artery, ischemic stroke were studied. Resting-state {EEG} was recorded 48-239 h after symptom onset. Relative power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, delta:alpha ratio, and peak alpha frequency were analyzed. Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) was administered, where possible, on day of {EEG} and at median 99 days (range 69-138) poststroke. Eight patients could not complete the baseline {MoCA}, and four the follow-up {MoCA}, for varying reasons (most commonly, stroke symptoms). Fifteen patients (48\%) had cognitive impairment ({MoCA} score ≤25) at follow-up. One {QEEG} index was able to correctly predict presence/absence of cognitive impairment in 24/31 patients (77.4\%), whereas predischarge {MoCA} did so in 23 patients. This index, relative theta frequency (4-7.5 Hz) power, was computed from only three posterior electrodes over the stroke-affected hemisphere. Its predictive accuracy (three electrodes) was higher than that of any "global" {QEEG} measure (averaged over 19 electrodes). These results may signify association between poststroke alpha slowing and cognitive impairment, which may be mediated by attentional (dys)function, which warrants further investigation. Pending further studies, {QEEG} measure(s)-from a few electrodes-could inform early prognostication of poststroke cognitive outcomes (and clinical decisions), particularly when cognitive function cannot be adequately assessed (due to symptoms, language, or other issues) or when assessment is equivocal.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of {CIND} in a hospital cohort before and after stroke during a 2-year follow up according to two alternative operational criteria.
{METHODS}: Three hundred twenty-seven consecutive stroke inpatients were prospectively evaluated with an extensive neuropsychological battery and the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in the Elderly ({IQCODE}) on admission and then at 3, 12, and 24 months after discharge. {CIND} was established according to two alternative operational criteria: proxy information (a cutoff score of 3.35 in the {IQCODE}: {IQ}-c) or to neuropsychologic examination (a score below the sixth percentile in {\textgreater}/=50\% of the tests exploring one cognitive domain: {NPE}-c).
{RESULTS}: A total of 12.6\% patients had {CIND} ({IQ}-c) before stroke. After 3 months, the {CIND} frequency was 26.9\% ({IQ}-c) or 19.6\% ({NPE}-c); after 12 months, 39.5\% or 26.8\%; and after 24 months, 36.6\% or 21\%. The risk for developing delayed dementia was significantly higher for poststroke patients with {CIND} diagnosed by {IQ}-c ({OR} 8.8), {NPE}-c ({OR} 10.3), or both criteria ({OR} 20.8).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with {CIND} are frequent before and after stroke and prone to delayed dementia. Both criteria are valid for identifying {CIND} cases and predicting long-term conversion to dementia, but {NPE}-c may be more adequate for the long-term follow up and {IQ}-c for detecting changes from prestroke status.},

	abstract = {Background Temporary and permanent cognitive changes following transient ischemic attack/minor stroke have been described previously. It is unknown if persisting cognitive deficits in these patients are correlated with acute infarction identified using magnetic resonance imaging. Aims We tested the hypothesis that persistent cognitive impairment after transient ischemic attack/minor stroke can be predicted by the volume of diffusion-weighted imaging lesions. Methods Acute transient ischemic attack/minor stroke ({NIH} stroke scale score ≤ 3) patients were prospectively recruited within 72 h of onset. Patients underwent Montreal cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging and Fluid-Attenuated Inverse Recovery sequences, at baseline, days 7 and 30. Cognitive testing was repeated at day 90. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesion and Fluid-Attenuated Inverse Recovery chronic white matter hyperintensity volumes were measured planimetrically. Cognitive impairment was defined a priori as Montreal cognitive assessment score {\textless} 26. Results One hundred fifteen patients were imaged at a median (inter-quartile range) of 24.0 (16.6) h after onset. Acute ischemic lesions were present in 91 (79\%) patients. Cognitive impairment rates were similar in patients with (47/91, 52\%) and without diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (13/24, 54\%; p = 0.83). Although linear regression indicated no relationship between acute diffusion-weighted imaging lesion volume and day 30 Montreal cognitive assessment scores (β = -0.163, [-2.243, 0.334], p = 0.144), white matter hyperintensity volumes at baseline were predictive of persistent cognitive deficits after 30 days (β = 2.24, [1.956, 45.369], p = 0.005). Conclusions In most transient ischemic attack/minor stroke patients who suffer acute cognitive impairment post event, deficits are temporary. Deficits after 30 days of onset are correlated with chronic white matter hyperintensity, suggesting subclinical cognitive impairment and/or impaired ability to compensate for the effects of acute ischemic infarcts.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To compare demographic data, clinical data, and rate of functional and cognitive recovery in patients with severe traumatic, cerebrovascular, or anoxic acquired brain injury ({ABI}) and to identify factors predicting discharge home.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Three hundred twenty-nine patients with severe {ABI} (192 with traumatic, 104 with cerebrovascular, and 33 with anoxic brain injury).
{DESIGN}: Longitudinal prospective study of inpatients attending the intensive Rehabilitation Department of the "Sacro Cuore" Don Calabria Hospital (Negrar, Verona, Italy).
{MAIN} {MEASURES}: Etiology, sex, age, rehabilitation admission interval, rehabilitation length of stay, discharge destination, Glasgow Coma Scale, Disability Rating Scale ({DRS}), Glasgow Outcome Scale, Levels of Cognitive Functioning, and Functional Independence Measure.
{RESULTS}: Predominant etiology was traumatic; male gender was prevalent in all the etiologic groups; patients with traumatic brain injury were younger than the patients in the other groups and had shorter rehabilitation admission interval, greater functional and cognitive outcomes on all considered scales, and a higher frequency of returning home. Patients with anoxic brain injury achieved the lowest grade of functional and cognitive recovery. Age, etiology, and admission {DRS} score predicted return home.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with traumatic brain injury achieved greater functional and cognitive improvements than patients with cerebrovascular and anoxic {ABI}. Age, etiology, and admission {DRS} score can assist in predicting discharge destination.},

The aim of this study was to identify a shorter cognitive screening test or combination of tests that yields the same results as the {CAMCOG}.
{METHODS}: A total of 169 stroke patients completed the {CAMCOG} and the abbreviated Rotterdam-{CAMCOG} (R-{CAMCOG}), Mini Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) and the cognitive part of the Functional Independence Measure ({FIM} cognition) after admission to clinical rehabilitation and 1 year after stroke. The {CAMCOG} score was used as criterion standard for validity.
{RESULTS}: Spearman correlations with the {CAMCOG} were very strong for the R-{CAMCOG} (both 0.92), strong for the {MMSE} (0.66 and 0.69) and moderate to weak for the {FIM} cognition (0.35 and 0.27). Stepwise linear regression analyses showed that, at admission, the R-{CAMCOG} explained 83\% of the variance in the {CAMCOG}. The {MMSE} and R-{CAMCOG} together explained 87\%. At 1 year after stroke the correlations and explained variances were similar.
{CONCLUSION}: The recently constructed R-{CAMCOG} appears an efficient alternative for the {CAMCOG} as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction of stroke patients.},

It is well documented that the function of autonomic nervous system is associated with depression and cognition. However, their relationship has never been investigated in the early poststroke phase. This pilot study aimed at determining whether resting heart rate ({HR}) parameters measured in early poststroke phase (1) are associated with early-phase measures of depression and cognition and (2) could be used as new tools for early objective prediction of {PSD} or {PSCI}, which could be applicable to patients unable to answer usual questionnaires.
{METHODS}: Fifty-four patients with first-ever ischemic stroke, without cardiac arrhythmia, were assessed for resting {HR} and heart rate variability ({HRV}) within the first week after stroke and for depression and cognition during the first week and at 3 months after stroke.
{RESULTS}: Multiple regression analyses controlled for age, gender, and stroke severity revealed that higher {HR}, lower {HRV}, and higher sympathovagal balance (low-frequency/high-frequency ratio of {HRV}) were associated with higher severity of depressive symptoms within the first week after stroke. Furthermore, higher sympathovagal balance in early phase predicted higher severity of depressive symptoms at the 3-month follow-up, whereas higher {HR} and lower {HRV} in early phase predicted lower global cognitive functioning at the 3-month follow-up.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Resting {HR} measurements obtained in early poststroke phase could serve as an objective tool, applicable to patients unable to complete questionnaires, to help in the early prediction of {PSD} and {PSCI}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Early identification of mood disorder post-stroke ({MDPS}) or its determinants could improve stroke outcomes. However, the natural history, prevalence and determinants of {MDPS} within the first weeks post-stroke require further investigation.
{METHODS}: Consecutive hospitalised stroke survivors were assessed within 2-5 days of stroke, and at 1 and 3 months post-stroke. Baseline data included demographics, co-morbidities, stroke subtype, pre-stroke disability and cognition. At baseline, 1- and 3-month interviews physical impairment, disability, cognition and social support were assessed. {MDPS} was defined as a score of {\textgreater}8 on the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Factors independently associated with {MDPS} at each time-point were determined using regression analyses.
{RESULTS}: One hundred and twenty-five subjects were included. The prevalence of {MDPS} within 5 days and at 1 and 3 months post-stroke was 5\%, 16\% and 21\% respectively. The independent determinants for {MDPS} at 1 month were disability, social support and change in impairment score between initial and 1-month assessments; and at 3 months were disability, social support and institutionalisation. Individuals moved in and out of the subset of depressed patients over time. {MDPS} was independently associated with mortality at 3 months post-stroke.
{CONCLUSION}: Mood disorder post-stroke increases in prevalence over the initial weeks post-stroke despite an improvement in disability, and is associated with mortality. Patients with {MDPS} at 1 month were not necessarily affected at 3 months and vice versa, indicating the dynamic nature of {MDPS} in the early stages.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Executive dysfunction is associated with impaired memory performance, but controversies remain about which aspects of memory are involved and how general intelligence influences these connections. We aimed to clarify these connections in stroke patients by comparing various memory measures in patients with and without executive impairment.
{METHODS}: Our consecutive cohort included patients with a first-ever ischemic stroke. Neuropsychological assessments were completed 6 months and 2 years after stroke. We classified patients as executively impaired, when at least two of five executive measures were defective at 6 months. At both 6 months and 2 years, we compared list learning of unrelated words, story recall, and recall of geometric figures in patients with and without executive impairment, while controlling for general intelligence.
{RESULTS}: Patients with executive impairment (n=66; 37\%) performed worse in list learning (p=.001; partial η2=.058) and immediate recall of a logical passage (p=.010; partial η2=.037) 6 months after stroke compared to executively intact patients (n=113). At the end of the 2-year follow-up period, the patients who were executively impaired at 6 months (n=53; 37\%) still performed worse than executively intact patients (n=92) in list learning (p{\textless}.001; partial η2=.096), and additionally in delayed recall of the list (p=.006; partial η2=.052) and immediate recall of geometric figures (p=.007; partial η2=.050).
{CONCLUSIONS}: In our working-aged stroke patients, executive impairment was common. Executive impairment was associated with memory tasks that provided less inherent structure and required the use of active memory strategies. Clinicians should remember this role of executive dysfunction when interpreting memory performance.},

{DESIGN}: A retrospective cohort study.
{SETTING}: A regional {IRH}.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Moderately (n = 614) and severely (n = 1294) impaired patients who had a stroke who were admitted to the facility between 2002 and 2006.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Not applicable.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Change in total, motor, and cognitive Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}) scores between {IRH} admission and discharge.
{RESULTS}: After controlling for patient demographics and initial medical conditions and functional status, shorter periods from stroke onset to {IRH} admission were significantly associated with greater functional gains for these patients during {IRH} hospitalization. Moderately impaired patients achieved a greater total {FIM} gain when admitted to an {IRH} within 21 days of stroke. Severely impaired patients showed a gradient relationship between time to {IRH} admission and total {FIM} gain, with significantly different functional gain if admitted to an {IRH} within 30 and 60 days after stroke diagnosis. Results of multiple regression analysis also showed that age, race/ethnicity, side of stroke, history of a previous stroke, functional measures at {IRH} admission, {IRH} length of stay, and selected medications were associated with total, motor, and cognitive {FIM} score changes. In addition, certain factors such as older age, diagnosis of a hemorrhagic stroke or a previous history of stroke, and initial functional status were associated with longer periods between diagnosis and admission to an {IRH} after the stroke occurred.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that earlier transfer to an {IRH} may lead to better functional improvement after stroke. However, certain factors such as age, race/ethnicity, initial medical conditions and functional status, and length of stay at an {IRH} contributed to functional gain. Factors affecting the time to {IRH} admission also were addressed.},

	doi = {10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.012278},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: It was recently demonstrated that cerebral microinfarcts ({CMIs}) can be detected in vivo using 3.0 tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging. We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and the longitudinal cognitive consequence of cortical {CMIs} on 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging, in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.
{METHODS}: A total of 231 patients undergoing 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging were included. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was used to evaluate global cognitive functions and cognitive domains (memory, language, and attention visuospatial and executive functions). Cognitive changes were represented by the difference in Montreal Cognitive Assessment score between baseline and 28-month after stroke/transient ischemic attack. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cortical {CMIs} and cognitive functions were explored using {ANCOVA} and regression models.
{RESULTS}: Cortical {CMIs} were observed in 34 patients (14.7\%), including 13 patients with acute (hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging) and 21 with chronic {CMIs} (isointense on diffusion-weighted imaging). Atrial fibrillation was a risk factor for all cortical {CMIs} (odds ratio, 4.8; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5-14.9; P=0.007). Confluent white matter hyperintensities was associated with chronic {CMIs} (odds ratio, 2.8; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-7.8; P=0.047). The presence of cortical {CMIs} at baseline was associated with worse visuospatial functions at baseline and decline over 28-month follow-up (β=0.5; 95\% confidence interval, 0.1-1.0; P=0.008, adjusting for brain atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and microbleeds).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Cortical {CMIs} are a common finding in patients with stroke/transient ischemic attack. Associations between {CMI} with atrial fibrillation and white matter hyperintensities suggest that these lesions have a heterogeneous cause, involving microembolism and cerebral small vessel disease. {CMI} seemed to preferentially impact visuospatial functions as assessed by a cognitive screening test.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Prospective cohort study of 186 consecutive acute stroke patients aged ≥65 years admitted to Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital, Australia 03/2002 to 03/2003. All subjects were followed up in 2007/8, at 5 years post-stroke, for outcome measures. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict 5-year survival using covariables, including functional status, age, stroke type and severity and vascular risk factors. Patients lost to follow-up (n = 20) were excluded from the analyses.
{RESULTS}: One hundred patients (60\%) were dead at study end. Predictors for survival in final logistic regression model were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale ({GCS}) on admission ({OR} 1.49, 95\%{CI} 1.1-2.0, P = 0.01), preadmission functional independence measure ({FIM}) score ({OR} 1.04, 95\%{CI} 1.0-1.1, P = 0.01), age ({OR} 0.93, 95\%{CI} 0.87-0.98, P = 0.01) and atrial fibrillation ({OR} 0.43, 95\% {CI} 0.19-0.95, P = 0.04).

	abstract = {Background
We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate prevalence of poststroke cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months after stroke onset and identify clinical and demographic factors associated with improvement or decline in cognitive function between 3 months and 12 months.

Methods
We analyzed the cognitive assessments of total patients and patients older than 65 years separately. All patients with an ischemic stroke were divided into normal cognitive group ({NCG}) and impaired cognition group ({ICG}) by using a cutoff score on the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-{MMSE}). Patients were additionally classified into 3 subgroups according to the changes in their K-{MMSE} scores between 3 and 12 months: Stable group with K-{MMSE} scores changes ranging from −2 to +2 points (−2 ≤ △{MMSE} ≤ +2); converter group with increase more than 3 points (3 ≤ △{MMSE}); and reverter group with decrease more than 3 points (−3 ≤ △{MMSE}). We also analyzed factors affecting cognitive change from 3 months to 12 months among the 3 groups including baseline medical record, stroke and treatment characteristics, and various functional assessments after 3 months.

Results
This study included 2,625 patients with the first time ischemic stroke. Among these patients, 1,735 (66.1\%) were classified as {NCG}, while 890 patients (33.9\%) were belonged to the {ICG} at 3 month. Within the {NCG}, 1,460 patients (82.4\%) were stable group, 93 patients (5.4\%) were converter group, and 212 patients (12.2\%) were reverter group at 12 months onset. Within the {ICG} group, 472 patients (53.0\%) were stable group, 321 patients (36.1\%) were converter group, and 97 patients (10.9\%) were reverter group. When different factors were investigated, the three subgroups in {NCG} and {ICG} showed significant different factors affecting cognitive function from 3 to 12 month.

Conclusions
The prevalence of cognitive impairment showed difference between 3,12 months. To analyze the cognitive change from 3 month to 12 month, the proportion stable group was dominant in {NCG} and converter group was higher in {ICG}. By investigating the influencing factors from each group, we were able to identify the predictors including the age factor.},

Identifying the most effective rehabilitation intervention is a recognized priority for stroke research and provides an opportunity to achieve a more desirable effect.
{OBJECTIVE}: The objective is to verify the effect of new technologies on motor outcomes of the upper limbs, functional state, and cognitive functions in post-stroke rehabilitation.
{METHODS}: Forty two post-stroke patients (8.69 ± 4.27 weeks after stroke onset) were involved in the experimental study during inpatient rehabilitation. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: conventional programs were combined with the Armeo Spring robot-assisted trainer (Armeo group; n = 17) and the Kinect-based system (Kinect group; n = 25). The duration of sessions with the new technological devices was 45 min/day (10 sessions in total). Functional recovery was compared among groups using the Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}), and upper limbs' motor function recovery was compared using the Fugl⁻Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity ({FMA}-{UE}), Modified Ashworth Scale ({MAS}), Hand grip strength (dynamometry), Hand Tapping test ({HTT}), Box and Block Test ({BBT}), and kinematic measures (active Range Of Motion ({ROM})), while cognitive functions were assessed by the {MMSE} (Mini-Mental State Examination), {ACE}-R (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised), and {HAD} (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) scores.
{RESULTS}: Functional independence did not show meaningful differences in scores between technologies (p {\textgreater} 0.05), though abilities of self-care were significantly higher after Kinect-based training (p {\textless} 0.05). The upper limbs' kinematics demonstrated higher functional recovery after robot training: decreased muscle tone, improved shoulder and elbow {ROMs}, hand dexterity, and grip strength (p {\textless} 0.05). Besides, virtual reality games involve more arm rotation and performing wider movements. Both new technologies caused an increase in overall global cognitive changes, but visual constructive abilities (attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and complex commands) were statistically higher after robotic therapy. Furthermore, decreased anxiety level was observed after virtual reality therapy (p {\textless} 0.05).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study displays that even a short-term, two-week training program with new technologies had a positive effect and significantly recovered post-strokes functional level in self-care, upper limb motor ability (dexterity and movements, grip strength, kinematic data), visual constructive abilities (attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and complex commands) and decreased anxiety level.},

{METHODS}: In a multicentre, partial-factorial trial, patients with recent stroke, absence of dementia, and systolic {BP} ({SBP}) 125-170 {mmHg} were assigned randomly to at least 6 months of intensive (target {SBP} {\textless}125 {mmHg}) or guideline (target {SBP} {\textless}140 {mmHg}) {BP} lowering. The subset of patients with ischaemic stroke and total cholesterol 3.0-8.0 mmol/l were also assigned randomly to intensive (target {LDL}-cholesterol {\textless}1.3 mmol/l) or guideline (target {LDL}-c {\textless}3.0 mmol/l) lipid lowering. The primary outcome was the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised ({ACE}-R).
{RESULTS}: We enrolled 83 patients, mean age 74.0 (6.8) years, and median 4.5 months after stroke. The median follow-up was 24 months (range 1-48). Mean {BP} was significantly reduced with intensive compared to guideline treatment (difference -10·6/-5·5 {mmHg}; p{\textless}0·01), as was total/{LDL}-cholesterol with intensive lipid lowering compared to guideline (difference -0·54/-0·44 mmol/l; p{\textless}0·01). The {ACE}-R score during treatment did not differ for either treatment comparison; mean difference for {BP} lowering -3.6 (95\% {CI} -9.7 to 2.4), and lipid lowering 4.4 (95\% {CI} -2.1 to 10.9). However, intensive lipid lowering therapy was significantly associated with improved scores for {ACE}-R at 6 months, trail making A, modified Rankin Scale and Euro-Qol Visual Analogue Scale. There was no difference in rates of dementia or serious adverse events for either comparison.
{CONCLUSION}: In patients with recent stroke and normal cognition, intensive {BP} and lipid lowering were feasible and safe, but did not alter cognition over two years. The association between intensive lipid lowering and improved scores for some secondary outcomes suggests further trials are warranted.

Cognitive functions and cardiorespiratory fitness were evaluated before and after intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up visit (episodic memory: revised-Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; working memory: Brown-Peterson paradigm; attention omission and commission errors: Continuous Performance Test; cardiorespiratory fitness: peak oxygen uptake during a symptom-limited, graded exercise test performed on a semirecumbent ergometer). Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by ranks evaluated differences in score distributions related to time (for the two groups combined). Post-hoc testing was adjusted for multiple comparisons. Compared with before the intervention, there was a significant reduction in attention errors immediately following the intervention (omission errors: 14.6±21.5 vs. 8±13.9, P=0.01; commission errors: 16.4±6.3 vs. 10.9±7.2, P=0.04), and in part at follow-up (omission errors on follow-up: 3.4±4.3, P=0.03; commission errors on follow-up: 13.2±7.6, P=0.42). These results suggest that attention may improve in chronic stroke survivors with cognitive impairment following short-term training that includes an aerobic component, without a change in cardiorespiratory fitness.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Patients with major stroke are often left with disability and may have depression and dementia during the recovery phase. Rehabilitation programmes have been shown to improve short-term physical outcome, but their long-term effectiveness and impact on dementia and depression are uncertain.
{METHODS}: We performed a 6-month randomized controlled trial of a home rehabilitation programme and compared it with the standard care patients with recent ischemic stroke receive. The intervention group received home-based physical therapy once a month for 6 months, along with educational support, counselling and audiovisual materials. The control group received rehabilitation as prescribed by a physician and educational materials upon discharge from hospital. The primary measurement was a change in Barthel Index. Secondary measurements were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ({HADS}) and Thai Mini-Mental State Examination.
{RESULTS}: Of the 68 screened patients, 60 patients were enrolled. At baseline, there was no significant difference in patient characteristics between the two groups. Over 2 years, the mean Barthel Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group (Barthel Index mean: from 31.7 ± 5.9 to 97.2 ± 2.8 vs from 33.2 ± 4.8 to 76.4 ± 9.4, P {\textless} 0.001; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale mean: from 16.1 ± 7.6 to 9.1 ± 0.3 vs 16.4 ± 4.9 to 9.1 ± 0.3, P= 0.003). Depression was strongly associated with being dependent on others. However, the Thai Mini-Mental State Examination in both groups did not significantly differ (Thai Mini-Mental State Examination mean: from 24.4 ± 2.0 to 24.6 vs 23.8 ± 1.9 to 24.1 ± 0.3, P= 0.068). There was no significant interaction between baseline characteristics and treatment outcome.
{CONCLUSIONS}: At 2 years follow-up, it was evident that a 6-month home rehabilitation programme after ischemic stroke improved functional outcome and reduced incidence of depression, but not dementia.},

A follow-up at 3 months was conducted to examine the retention of motor gains. Both groups significantly improved their motor function, and no differences between groups were found. The only difference between groups was observed in the language domain for {QoL}. Importantly, an association was encountered between the capacity to experience pleasure from music activities and the motor improvement in the {MST} group. {MST} as an add-on treatment showed no superiority to conventional therapies for motor recovery. Importantly, patient's intrinsic motivation to engage in musical activities was associated with better motor improvement.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Vascular risk factor control may not only prevent stroke but also reduce the risk of dementia. We investigated whether a multifactorial intervention program reduces the incidence of cognitive symptoms one-year after stroke and transient ischemic attack in first ever stroke patients without cognitive decline prior to the stroke.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Patients suffering their first ever stroke were included in this randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled trial with two parallel groups. Baseline examination included extensive assessment of exposure to vascular risk factors and cognitive assessments regarding memory, attention, and executive function. After discharge, patients were allocated to either intensive vascular risk factor intervention or care as usual. The primary end points were changes in trailmaking test A and 10-word test from baseline to 12 months follow-up.
{RESULTS}: One hundred ninety-five patients were randomized. The difference between groups in trail-making test A, adjusted for baseline measurements, was 3·8 s (95\% confidence interval: -4·2 to 11·9; P=0·35) in favor of the intervention group. The difference between groups in the 10-word recall test was 1·1 words (95\% confidence interval: -0·5 to 2·7; P=0·17) in favor of the intervention group. We did not observe any differences in the secondary outcomes of incident dementia or mild cognitive impairment.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We could not demonstrate cognitive effects of an intensive risk factor intervention at one-year poststroke. Longer follow-up and a more heterogeneous study sample might have lead to larger effects. More effective methods for managing the risk of further cognitive decline after stroke are needed.},

In total, 12 training sessions (90 minutes a session, twice a week) were conducted in both groups, and performance was assessed at three time points (pretest, post-test, and follow-up) by a blinded assessor. The outcome measures were the Berg Balance Scale ({BBS}), Functional Reach Test, and Timed Up and Go Test (cognitive; {TUG}-cog) for balance evaluations; Modified Barthel Index for activities of daily living ability; Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale for balance confidence; and Stroke Impact Scale for quality of life. The pleasure scale and adverse events were also recorded after each training session.
{RESULTS}: Both groups exhibited significant improvement over time in the {BBS} (P = 0.000) and {TUG}-cog test (P = 0.005). The {VR} group rated the experience as more pleasurable than the {ST} group during the intervention (P = 0.027). However, no significant difference was observed in other outcome measures within or between the groups. No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment in either group.

Functional assessments, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subtest, verbal fluency, and Color Trail Making A and B, were administered before and 3 months after intervention.Results—Successful recanalization was achieved in 12 of 20 patients (60\%). There was no procedural or new cerebral ischemic event, except for 1 intracranial hemorrhage, which occurred during the procedure and had neurologic sequelae; this case was excluded from analysis. The demographics and baseline cognitive performance were similar between the group with a successful outcome (group 1, n=12) and patients who did not (group 2, n=7). Ten of 12 patients in group 1 had improvement in ipsilateral brain perfusion after the procedure, but none in group 2 had improvement.

{METHOD}: We performed a post hoc analysis of the extensive longitudinal database from the 3,680 subjects (over 35 years old) entered between 1996 and 2003 into the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention trial using a linear mixed effects model. The primary outcome variables were scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE}) and modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}).
{RESULTS}: {MMSE} and {mRS} gradually improved during the 2-year follow-up period. Increased age and nonwhite race, recurrent stroke, diabetes mellitus, left hemisphere cortical lesions, and values of high-density lipoprotein and homocysteine were independent predictors of less successful cognitive recovery. A strong interaction between homocysteine and age indicated a threshold effect beginning in the late 50s. No vitamin treatment effects were identified. Similar factors were identified for recovery of disability as assessed by the {mRS}, although there were qualitative and quantitative differences.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The finding that diabetes, high-density lipoprotein, and homocysteine predict poorer cognitive function and greater disability after stroke is consistent with the hypothesis that metabolic stress plays a significant role in the poststroke period.},

Twenty-two participants completed the majority of training (≥18/25 sessions) and were entered into longitudinal analyses. Results Significant correlations between {FA} and baseline cognitive functions were observed (r = 0.58, p = 0.004), however, no evidence was found of generally improved cognitive functions following training or of changes in white matter microstructure.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Paired exercise and cognitive training have the potential to enhance cognition by "priming" the brain and upregulating neurotrophins.
{METHODS}: Two-site randomized controlled trial. Fifty-two patients {\textgreater}6 months poststroke with concerns about cognitive impairment trained 50 to 70 minutes, 3× week for 10 weeks with 12-week follow-up. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 physical interventions: Aerobic ({\textgreater}60\% {VO}2peak using {\textless}10\% body weight-supported treadmill) or Activity (range of movement and functional tasks). Exercise was paired with 1 of 2 cognitive interventions (computerized dual working memory training [{COG}] or control computer games [Games]). The primary outcome for the 4 groups (Aerobic + {COG}, Aerobic + Games, Activity + {COG}, and Activity + Games) was fluid intelligence measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices Test administered at baseline, posttraining, and 3-month follow-up. Serum neurotrophins collected at one site (N = 30) included brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}) at rest ({BDNFresting}) and after a graded exercise test ({BDNFresponse}) and insulin-like growth factor-1 at the same timepoints ({IGF}-1rest, {IGF}-1response).
{RESULTS}: At follow-up, fluid intelligence scores significantly improved compared to baseline in the Aerobic + {COG} and Activity + {COG} groups; however, only the Aerobic + {COG} group was significantly different (+47.8\%) from control (Activity + Games -8.5\%). Greater {IGF}-1response at baseline predicted 40\% of the variance in cognitive improvement. There was no effect of the interventions on {BDNFresting} or {BDNFresponse}; nor was {BDNF} predictive of the outcome.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Aerobic exercise combined with cognitive training improved fluid intelligence by almost 50\% in patients {\textgreater}6 months poststroke. Participants with more robust improvements in cognition were able to upregulate higher levels of serum {IGF}-1 suggesting that this neurotrophin may be involved in behaviorally induced plasticity.},

Method Participants received 16 h of either {CO}-{OP} or {COMPUTER} training. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of each intervention, and change in intervention outcomes at baseline, post-intervention and one-month follow-up. Performance and satisfaction with performance in self-selected everyday life goals were measured by the participant and the significant other-rated Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ({COPM}). Other intervention outcomes included changes in {EF} impairment, participation in daily life and self-efficacy. Results Six participants received {CO}-{OP} and five received {COMPUTER} training: one in each group discontinued the intervention for medical reasons unrelated to the intervention. The remaining nine participants completed all 16 sessions. Participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with both interventions. Both treatment groups showed large improvements in self and significant other-rated performance and satisfaction with performance on their goals immediately post-intervention and at follow-up ({CO}-{OP}: effect sizes ({ES}) = 1.6-3.5; {COMPUTER}: {ES} = 0.9-4.0), with statistically significant within-group differences in {CO}-{OP} (p {\textless} 0.05). The {COMPUTER} group also showed large improvements in some areas of {EF} impairment targeted by the computerised tasks ({ES} = 0.9-1.6); the {CO}-{OP} group demonstrated large improvements in self-efficacy for performing everyday activities ({ES} = 1.5). Conclusions Our findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of using both {CO}-{OP} and {COMPUTER} training with patients with executive dysfunction post-stroke. Implications for Rehabilitation Computerised executive function training and occupation-based strategy training are feasible to deliver and acceptable to persons with executive dysfunction post-stroke. Preliminary evidence suggests that both interventions have a positive impact on real-world outcomes; and, that {CO}-{OP} might have a greater impact on improving self-efficacy for performing everyday activities.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Having previously reported that comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation ({CCR}) is effective for secondary prevention post-transient ischemic attack ({TIA})/mild nondisabling stroke ({MNDS}), we present psychometric findings for the same sample that elucidate subacute {TIA}/{MNDS} psychological outcomes and test whether {CCR} would be independently associated with psychological improvements.
{METHODS}: In this prospective cohort trial patients with ≥1 risk factor, recruited from a stroke prevention clinic within 12 months (mean = 11.5 weeks) post-{TIA}/{MNDS}, entered {CCR}.
{RESULTS}: Of the 110 recruited patients, 100 (mean age = 65.4 years; 46 females) entered {CCR} and 80 completed {CCR} (mean duration = 7.6 months). At {CCR} entry, 16.5\% and 39.2\% screened positively for depression and anxiety, decreasing nonsignificantly at exit to 4.2\%, and significantly to 16.9\% (P = .008), respectively. Age-corrected deficits occurred more frequently than expected (P ≤ .03); at entry, mental health status (13.3\%), clock-drawing (31.6\%), oral-verbal fluency (16.9\%), word-list learning (11.2\%), and recall (12.6\%); at exit, clock-drawing (30.0\%). Entry-to-exit, mean depression, anxiety, mental and physical health status, word-list learning, memory, digit-symbol coding, and oral-verbal fluency scores improved significantly (P ≤ .031). No reliable change indices were significant. Psychological service recipients improved significantly more than nonrecipients in depression (P = .049). Baseline North American Adult Reading Test score predicted exercise attendance (R = 0.275; P = .044); New York Heart Association ({NYHA}) class and depression score predicted exit physical health status (R = 0.770, P {\textless} .001); and depression score predicted exit mental health status (R = 0.523, P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Anxiety and executive dysfunction persisted post-{TIA}/{MNDS}. Although promising for secondary prevention post-{TIA}/{MNDS}, {CCR} was not independently associated with psychological improvements. {CCR} psychological treatment may benefit depression. Subacute {NYHA} class and depression may later affect quality of life.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine the efficacy of activity-based therapies using arm ergometer or robotic or group occupational therapy for motor recovery of the paretic arm in patients with an acute stroke ({\textless} or =4 weeks) admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, and to obtain information to plan a large randomized controlled trial.
{DESIGN}: Prospective, randomized controlled study.
{SETTING}: Stroke unit in a rehabilitation hospital.
{SUBJECTS}: Thirty patients with an acute stroke ({\textless} or =4 weeks) who had arm weakness (Medical Research Council grade 2 or less at the shoulder joint).
{INTERVENTION}: Occupational therapy ({OT}) group (control) (n = 10), arm ergometer (n = 10) or robotic (n = 10) therapy group. All patients received standard, inpatient, post-stroke rehabilitation training for 3 hours a day, plus 12 additional 40-minute sessions of the activity-based therapy.
{MAIN} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome measures were discharge scores in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale for upper limb impairment, Motor Status Scale, total Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}) and {FIM}-motor and {FIM}-cognition subscores.
{RESULTS}: The three groups ({OT} group versus arm ergometer versus robotic) were comparable on clinical demographic measures except the robotic group was significantly older and there were more haemorrhagic stroke patients in the arm ergometer group. After adjusting for age, stroke type and outcome measures at baseline, a similar degree of improvement in the discharge scores was found in all of the primary outcome measures.
{CONCLUSION}: This study suggests that activity-based therapies using an arm ergometer or robot when used over shortened training periods have the same effect as {OT} group therapy in decreasing impairment and improving disability in the paretic arm of severely affected stroke patients in the subacute phase.},

We therefore tested whether intensive nutritional supplements given to undernourished patients from the time of their admission to a specialized stroke rehabilitation service would improve patient outcomes.
{METHODS}: Randomized, prospective, double-blind, single center study comparing intensive nutritional supplementation to routine nutritional supplementation in 116 undernourished patients admitted to a stroke service. The analysis included the 90\% of patients who were not lost to follow-up due to acute or subacute hospitalization (n = 102; 51 in each group). The nutritional supplements are commercially available and Food and Drug Administration approved. The primary outcome variable was change in total score on the Functional Independence Measure ({FIM}). The secondary outcome measurements included the {FIM} motor and cognitive subscores, length of stay (taken from day of admission), 2-minute and 6-minute timed walk tests measured at admission and on discharge, and discharge disposition (home/not home).
{RESULTS}: Patients receiving intensive nutritional supplementation improved more than those on standard nutritional supplements on measures of motor function (total {FIM}, {FIM} motor subscore, 2-minute and 6-minute timed walk tests, all significant at p {\textless} 0.002). They did not, however, improve on measures of cognition ({FIM} cognition score). A higher proportion of patients who received the intensive nutritional supplementation went home compared to those on standard supplementation (p = 0.05).
{CONCLUSION}: Intensive nutritional supplementation, using readily available commercial preparations, improves motor recovery in previously undernourished patients receiving intensive in-patient rehabilitation after stroke.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Physical activity is beneficial for improving cognitive function in healthy older adults. However, research results on the benefits of physical activity on cognitive performance after stroke are limited.
{OBJECTIVE}: To determine if a combined exercise and recreation program can improve the executive functioning and memory of individuals with chronic stroke.
{METHODS}: In all, 11 ambulatory participants with chronic stroke (mean age 67 ± 10.8 years) participated in a 6-month program of exercise for 2 hours and recreation for 1 hour weekly. Executive functions and memory were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months by a battery of standard neuropsychological tests, including response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, dual task (motor plus cognitive), and memory. Motor ability was also assessed. Nonparametric statistics were used to obtain the differences between the 3 assessments.
{RESULTS}: At baseline, substantial deficits in all aspects of executive functioning were revealed. From baseline to 3 months, the mean improvement was 10\% ± 14\% for the dual task (Walking While Talking), -3\% ± 22\% (χ(2) = 2.4; P {\textgreater} .05) for response inhibition (Stroop Test), and 61\% ± 69\% for memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-long delay). From baseline to 6 months, the mean improvement was 7\% ± 7.5\% for response inhibition (Stroop Test). In addition, knee strength and walking speed improved significantly at 3 months.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This pilot study suggests that exercise and recreation may improve memory and executive functions of community-dwelling individuals with stroke. Further studies require a larger sample size and a control group.},

	shorttitle = {Improving executive function deficits by playing interactive video-games},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Executive function deficits negatively impact independence and participation in everyday life of individuals with chronic stroke. Therefore, it is important to explore therapeutic interventions to improve executive functions.
{AIM}: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a 3-month interactive video-game group intervention compared to a traditional motor group intervention for improving executive functions in individuals with chronic stroke.
{DESIGN}: This study is a secondary analysis of a single-blind randomized controlled trial for improving factors related to physical activity of individuals with chronic stroke. Assessments were administered pre and post the intervention and at 3-month follow-up by assessors blind to treatment allocation.
{METHODS}: Thirty-nine individuals with chronic stroke with executive function deficits participated in an interactive video-game group intervention (N.=20) or a traditional group intervention (N.=19). The intervention included two 1-hour group sessions per week for three months, either playing video-games or performing traditional exercises/activities. Executive function deficits were assessed using The Trail Making Test (Parts A and B) and by two performance-based assessments; the Bill Paying Task from the Executive Function Performance Test ({EFPT}) and the Executive Function Route-Finding Task ({EFRT}).
{RESULTS}: Following intervention, scores for the Bill Paying Task ({EFPT}) decreased by 27.5\% and 36.6\% for the participants in the video-game and traditional intervention, respectively (F=17.3, P{\textless}0.000) and continued to decrease in the video-game group with small effect sizes. Effect size was small to medium for the {TMT}-B (F=0.003, P=0.954) and {EFRT} (F=1.2, P=0.28), without any statistical significance difference.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Interactive video-games provide combined cognitive-motor stimulation and therefore have potential to improve executive functioning of individuals with chronic stroke. Further research is needed.
{CLINICAL} {REHABILITATION} {IMPACT}: These findings highlight the potential of utilizing interactive video-games in a small group for keeping these individuals active, while maintaining and improving executive functioning especially for individuals with chronic stroke, who have completed their formal rehabilitation.},

One purpose of this study was to determine whether the motor abilities of subjects who have poststroke cognitive deficits and who have received problem-oriented willed-movement ({POWM}) therapy will improve more than the motor abilities of subjects in the reference group who have received neurodevelopmental treatment ({NDT}). Another purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between cognitive function and motor abilities for both groups.
{SUBJECTS}: The subjects recruited for this study were 36 men and 11 women with various degrees of poststroke cognitive deficits.
{METHODS}: A randomized block design was used to assign the subjects to 2 groups. Cognitive function and motor ability were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement ({STREAM}). Both groups received physical therapy 5 or 6 times per week in 50-minute sessions.
{RESULTS}: The {STREAM} scores improved after treatment in both groups. Main group effects were found for the lower-extremity (F=4.58, P{\textless} .05) and basic mobility (F=27.49, P{\textless} .01) subscales of the {STREAM}. Pretest cognitive function showed a positive relationship with posttest motor ability in the {NDT} group (r = .446, P{\textless} .05). However, the relationship between pretest cognitive function and posttest motor ability had no statistical significance in the {POWM} group (r = .101, P= .630).
{DISCUSSION} {AND} {CONCLUSION}: These findings suggest that, regardless of a person's cognitive function, {POWM} intervention is effective in improving lower-extremity and basic mobilities and indicates the need to use relatively intact cognitive function or perceptual function, or both, to improve motor rehabilitation for people with cognitive function deficits.},

The aim of this study is to report the relationship between cognitive function and risk factors at baseline and during follow-up in the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent stroke in Intracranial Stenosis ({SAMMPRIS}) trial.
{METHODS}: Subjects in the {SAMMPRIS} trial were included in this study. In order to have an assessment of cognitive function independent of stroke, patients with a stroke as a qualifying event whose deficits included aphasia or neglect were excluded from these analyses as were those with a cerebrovascular event during follow-up. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) score was used to assess cognitive impairment at baseline, 4 months, 12 months and closeout. Cognitive impairment was defined as {MoCA} {\textless} 26. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine what risk factors were independent predictors of cognitive function at baseline, 12 months and closeout. Among patients randomized to aggressive medical management only, the percentage of patients with cognitive impairment was compared between patients in versus out of target for each risk factor at 12 months and closeout.
{RESULTS}: Of the 451 patients in {SAMMPRIS}, 371 patients met the inclusion criteria. {MoCA} {\textless} 26 was present in 55\% at baseline. Older age and physical inactivity were associated with cognitive impairment at baseline. Older age, non-white race, lower baseline body mass index, and baseline cognitive impairment were associated with cognitive impairment at 12 months. In the aggressive medical management group, at 12 months, physical inactivity during follow-up was the strongest risk factor associated with cognitive impairment.
{CONCLUSION}: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with severe symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis. Physical inactivity at baseline and during follow-up is a strong predictor of cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cerebral infarction frequently leads to mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}). Prompt management of {MCI} can prevent vascular dementia and improve patient outcome. This single center randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and nimodipine to treat post-cerebral infarction {MCI}.
{METHODS}: A total of 126 Chinese patients with post-cerebral infarction {MCI} recruited from the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between April 2013 and June 2014 were randomized at 1:1: 1 ratio into nimodipine alone (30 mg/time and 3 times daily), acupuncture alone (30 min/time, 6 times/week), and nimodipine + acupuncture groups. The treatments were 3 months. Cognitive function was evaluated using Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA}) scale at enrollment interview, at the end of 3-month therapy, and at the post-treatment 3-month follow-up.
{RESULTS}: The per-protocol set included 39, 40, and 40 patients from nimodipine alone, acupuncture alone, and the combination group, respectively, was analyzed. Intra-group comparison revealed that {MoCA} score at the follow-up improved significantly by 15.8 ± 10.9, 20.9 ± 13.8 \%, and 30.2 ± 19.7 \% compared with the baseline {MoCA} for nimodipine alone, acupuncture alone, and the combination group, respectively. Inter-group comparison demonstrated that the combination therapy improved {MoCA} score (5.5 ± 2.2) at significantly higher extent than nimodipine alone (3.1 ± 1.8) and acupuncture alone (4.3 ± 2.3) at the follow-up (All P {\textless} 0.05), and significantly higher proportion of patients in acupuncture alone group (80 \%) and the combination therapy group (90 \%) than in nimodipine alone group (56.4 \%) showed ≥12 \% {MoCA} score improvement compared with the baseline {MoCA} (All P {\textless} 0.05). No adverse event was reported during the study.

{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the effects of a Time Pressure Management ({TPM}) strategy taught to stroke patients with mental slowness, compared with the effects of care as usual.
{DESIGN}: Randomized controlled trial with outcome assessments conducted at baseline, at the end of treatment (at 5-10wk), and at 3 months.
{SETTING}: Eight Dutch rehabilitation centers.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Stroke patients (N=37; mean age +/- {SD}, 51.5+/-9.7y) in rehabilitation programs who had a mean Barthel score +/- {SD} at baseline of 19.6+/-1.1.
{INTERVENTION}: Ten hours of treatment teaching patients a {TPM} strategy to compensate for mental slowness in real-life tasks.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Mental Slowness Observation Test and Mental Slowness Questionnaire.
{RESULTS}: Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental treatment (n=20) and to care as usual (n=17). After 10 hours of treatment, both groups showed a significant decline in number of complaints on the Mental Slowness Questionnaire. This decline was still present at 3 months. At 3 months, the Mental Slowness Observation Test revealed significantly higher increases in speed of performance of the {TPM} group in comparison with the care-as-usual group (t=-2.7, P=.01).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although the {TPM} group and the care-as-usual group both showed fewer complaints after a 3-month follow-up period, only the {TPM} group showed improved speed of performance on everyday tasks. Use of {TPM} treatment therefore is recommended when treating stroke patients with mental slowness.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the effects of robotic rehabilitation on upper extremity functions, cognitive development, and activities of daily living in patients with subacute stroke.
{METHODS}: This study was set as prospective and controlled. Subjects with subacute stroke were allocated into two groups as the robotic and control groups. All subjects received a conventional rehabilitation program five times a week for 3 weeks. In addition, robotic group received robotic rehabilitation five times a week for 3 weeks (30 minutes per session).
{RESULTS}: There were 20 patients in the robotic group (mean age of 63.27 ± 3.88 years) and 15 patients in the control group (mean age of 59.25 ± 8.10 years). Compared with baseline, the Functional independence measure (both motor and cognitive subscale), Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale, and Motricity Index values did increase in both groups. Change levels of Fugl-Meyer Assessment {FMA} shoulder/elbow/forearm, and Motricity Index shoulder scores were significantly higher in the robotic group than the control group (p{\textless} 0.05). Compared with the baseline, physical component summary scores improved only in the robotic group, yet motor component summary scores improved only in the control group. Although Brunnstrom levels increased in both groups compared with baseline, change levels were similar.
{CONCLUSION}: In the light of our results, robotic rehabilitation in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program seems to be effective on improving motor recovery and the quality of life in subacute stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Post-stroke depression ({PSD}) is a common yet severe sequela of stroke, and is often accompanied with somatic symptoms. Duloxetine, a new serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may help to prevent depression after stroke. 95 ischemic stroke patients without depression were randomly divided into two groups: duloxetine group (n = 47) and control group (n = 48). Patients in the control group received routine ischemic stroke therapy, whereas patients in the duloxetine group received duloxetine (dose range 30-90 mg) for 12 weeks in addition to routine therapy. Follow-up observations lasted for 24 weeks. The Hamilton Depression Scale was used to measure depression, and the National Institute of Stroke Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Activities of Daily Living Scale (Chinese version) and Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire were used to assess neurological function, cognitive function, rehabilitation from stroke and quality of life. Results showed that in general, duloxetine spared ischemic stroke patients from both minor and major depression by 16\%. In addition, duloxetine helped patients to rehabilitate more rapidly from stroke, and was associated with better cognitive function and quality of life. In conclusion, the prophylactic use of duloxetine not only decreased the incidence of {PSD}, but also promoted rehabilitation, cognitive function and quality of life.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cerebralcare Granule ({CG}) is a polyherbal Chinese medicine that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in experimental models of stroke. We compared the efficacy and safety of {CG} with aspirin in patients with acute stroke.
{METHODS}: For this open-label, controlled trial, we recruited patients with angiographically confirmed strokes and {US} National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) scores of 4-22 within 2 weeks of symptom onset; recruitment was performed at 55 sites in China. Patients received {CG} or aspirin. The primary efficacy end-point was neurological function. Analyses were done by intention to treat. Patients were measured for {NIHSS}, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores and Barthel index at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment.
{RESULTS}: Between January 2013 and January 2014, we treated 1963 patients with {CG} and 1288 patients with aspirin. Baseline {NIHSS}, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were comparable between the two groups. Patients in the {CG} group had a greater improvement than the aspirin group in terms of {NIHSS} (P {\textless} 0.01) and Barthel index at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks, patients in the {CG} group had a greater improvement than the aspirin group in terms of Mini-Mental State Examination (P {\textless} 0.01) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (P {\textless} 0.05). Adverse reactions were similar between the two groups.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This large-scale, controlled trial indicated that {CG} may be a useful treatment in the management of post-stroke patients.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the impact of unilateral spatial neglect ({USN}) on the rehabilitation outcome and long-term functioning in activities of daily living ({ADL}) and instrumental {ADL} ({IADL}) of right hemisphere damaged ({RHD}) stroke patients.
{DESIGN}: Assessments of sensory-motor and cognitive impairment and of functional disability were conducted upon admission to rehabilitation, upon discharge from the rehabilitation hospital, and 6 months after discharge, up to a year postonset.
{SETTING}: The Loewenstein Rehabilitation Hospital, which receives patients from all general hospitals in Israel.
{PATIENTS}: Forty consecutive admissions of adult right-handed patients with a first, single, right hemispheric stroke proven by computed tomography. Based on their total score in the Behavioral Inattention Test for neglect, patients were divided into two groups: 19 with neglect ({USN}+) and 21 without neglect ({USN}-).
{OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Functional Independence Measure, for {ADL}; The Rabideau Kitchen Evaluation, for {IADL}.
{RESULTS}: Impairment and disability levels of {RHD} patients with and without {USN} were clearly differentiated. Neglect is associated with lower performance on measures of impairment (sensory-motor and cognitive), as well as on measures of disability in {ADL} and {IADL}. Differences were significant in all testing periods. The recovery pattern of {USN}+ patients is slower and more attenuated. In both groups, most improvement occurs in the first 5 months after onset. {USN} is the major predictor of rehabilitation outcome from admission to follow-up.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The significance of neglect as a major source of stroke-related long-term disability justifies further research efforts to develop appropriate therapeutic modalities for this complex, multifactorial syndrome.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To identify relationships between sleep patterns and functional outcomes in patients with subacute stroke with insomnia.
{DESIGN}: We prospectively studied 30 patients with subacute stroke. Each patient completed the St. Mary's Hospital sleep questionnaire, the Korean modified Barthel index, a computerized neuropsychological test, and the Beck depression inventory. The time interval between baseline and follow-up was 3 wks. Patients with insomnia were all treated with hypnotics, and patients were divided into two groups according to sleep patterns.
{RESULTS}: Poor sleep quality, decreased total sleep time, and increased frequency of nocturnal awakening were observed in patients with insomnia, but sleep patterns improved, when hypnotics were administered, to levels comparable with those of the (noninsomnia) control group. There was no significant difference in functional, cognitive, or depressive status between the insomnia and noninsomnia groups at baseline, but attention in patients with insomnia tended to be lower. At follow-up, functional and cognitive status had improved in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the two groups in sleep quality, sleep time, or nocturnal awakening.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with stroke with insomnia showed poor sleep patterns. Active management improved sleep patterns and helped such patients achieve functional and cognitive outcomes equivalent to those attained by patients without insomnia.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Neurologically impaired persons seem to benefit from driving-training programs, but there is no convincing evidence to support this notion. The authors therefore investigated the effect of simulator-based training on driving after stroke.
{METHODS}: Eighty-three first-ever subacute stroke patients entered a 5-week 15-hour training program in which they were randomly allocated to either an experimental (simulator-based training) or control (driving-related cognitive tasks) group. Performance in off-road evaluations and an on-road test were used to assess the driving ability of subjects pre- and post-training. Outcome of an official predriving assessment administered 6 to 9 months poststroke was also considered.
{RESULTS}: Both groups significantly improved in a visual and many neuropsychological evaluations and in the on-road test after training. There were no significant differences between both groups in improvements from pre- to post-training except in the "road sign recognition test" in which the experimental subjects improved more. Significant improvements in the three-class decision ("fit to drive," "temporarily unfit to drive," and "unfit to drive") were found in favor of the experimental group post-training. Academic qualification and overall disability together determined subjects that benefited most from the simulator-based driving training. Significantly more experimental subjects (73\%) than control subjects (42\%) passed the follow-up official predriving assessment and were legally allowed to resume driving.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Simulator-based driving training improved driving ability, especially for well educated and less disabled stroke patients. However, the findings of the study may have been modified as a result of the large number of dropouts and the possibility of some neurologic recovery unrelated to training.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Stroke survivors represent a target population in need of intervention strategies to promote cognitive function and prevent dementia. Both exercise and recreational activities are promising strategies. We assessed the effect of a 6-month exercise and recreation program on executive functions in adults with chronic stroke.
{METHODS}: A 6-month ancillary study within a multicentre randomized trial. Twenty-eight chronic stroke survivors (ie, ≥ 12 months since an index stroke) were randomized to 1 of 2 experimental groups: intervention ({INT}; n = 12) or delayed intervention (D-{INT}; n = 16). Participants of the {INT} group received a 6-month community-based structured program that included 2 sessions of exercise training and 1 session of recreation and leisure activities per week. Participants of the D-{INT} group received usual care. The primary outcome measure was the Stroop Test, a cognitive test of selective attention and conflict resolution. Secondary cognitive measures included set shifting and working memory. Mood, functional capacity, and general balance and mobility were additional secondary outcome measures.
{RESULTS}: Compared with the D-{INT} group, the {INT} group significantly improved selective attention and conflict resolution (P = .02), working memory (P = .04), and functional capacity (P = .02) at the end of the 6-month intervention period. Improved selective attention and conflict resolution was significantly associated with functional capacity at 6 months (r = .39; P = .04).
{CONCLUSIONS}: This is the first randomized study to demonstrate that an exercise and recreation program can significantly benefit executive functions in community-dwelling chronic stroke survivors who are mildly cognitively impaired-a population at high-risk for dementia and functional decline. Thus, clinicians should consider prescribing exercise and recreational activities in the cognitive rehabilitation of chronic stroke survivors.},
